"The Table, the international crminal brotherhood which has condemned John Wick empowers The Marquis to deal with him (and the Manager of the New York Continentale Hotel). But maybe, just maybe, there is a way out. As expected, the IMDB is full of people saluting this as ""Best John Wick yet,"" ""A masterpiece,"" ""Best action movie ever,"" etc. My view differs. But I must start by giving credit where it is due. Production design, cinematography, action choreography and direction are all first rate, and they deserved a much better film that this is. And this film deserved a much better script than this.
 The story is fine, quite good even, but it is buried under industrial quantities of action which defies belief. Everbody's resistance to trauma and the complete absence of police are just the big two, but let's not forget the endless succession of pairs of heavies coming out of nowhere and only stopping when Wick has no gun.  And even the scriot deserved a better actor than Keanu Reeves. To be fair, the character in the first film has been reduced to a mere cardboard cutout here, but Reeves (who I genuinely like as a performer) doesn't even play cardboard well here. This is beautifully crafted drivel. 7 for craft, 3 for Reeves' central performance, averages to 5.",0
"Half of this review will be me gushing about the action. Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series. I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow. There is every kind of fighting imaginable. So many weapons, styles, chases, vehicles, animals, everything. So much creativity with the kills. Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles (pistol/sword combo is my fave). The music is awesome as usual, maybe even a step up. It enhances every action scene. The cinematography is pristine. So many beautiful shots, so many mesmerizing locations for the action. It is stylistically beautiful. There are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that I've never seen before. One is an overhead shot one-take that I couldn't believe. It takes the movie to a new level. So many scenes feel like they're a video game brought to life. Numerous times it feels like the VR game Pistol Whip. Donnie Yen is awesome. End of paragraph. About an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie, I felt like I experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. I was in a state of ecstasy. Not only was this looking like the best of the series, I started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. Maybe it's my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie, but the second half is more flawed, though still awesome. The subplot with the tracker doesn't seem at all consequential. And his dog attacks were already done, and better, with Halle Berry in Parabellum. A few of the issues I had with Parabellum pop up again, like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. For example, instead of getting hit by one car, he gets hit by three cars. And that's a mild example. Also, it's fairly anticlimactic. Even with those flaws, I had a BLAST with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. Seeing it on a premium screen is a must. Loudest speakers, biggest screen. TRUST ME. EDIT: I was itching to go again since opening night. I wasn't able to wait more than 5 days. On second viewing, I still felt the same flaws, but I didn't care. The action is incredible. It has at least four* of my all-time favorite action scenes. I want to watch these scenes a hundred times. It's definitely not perfect, but I still consider it an action landmark (last time I said that was Mad Max: Fury Road). Every other action movie should learn from this. Updating rating from 8 to 9 stars. ",1
"These John Wick movies can be sort of fun in the sense that they are unintelligent violent nonsense pretending to be movies. There is something entertaining about dumb nonsense sometimes, and the first two of this franchise was decently okay in this regard. The last one and this one however not so much, only dumb. This movie is almost 3 hours long, and oh boy do you feel every minute. Because if you have seen the previous instalments you have seen this one to. This is like a bad video game repeating the same thing, the same course, the same enemies, and for the 4th time. There is also a post credit scene, which is simply dumb, no reason to stil around for it. The acting is also horrid, and if you are going to buy any of this you have to have good acting but no. The only positive I can say about this movie is that it is not as putrified as many other movies lately so for a contemporary action movie this is not as bad as much else. I give this a very, very generous 3/10. If you want to watch this, don't. Go watch the first one, and maybe the second one instead. Those are also highly stupid, but at least decently entertaining, this is not.",0
"Imagine a video game where you are shooting bad guys. Your hardware is old so everything is kind of slow and out of focus. The opponents are set to Easy and you installed a hack to give you invincibility and autoaim. And they come at you slowly, shouting, out in the open, with weapons that fire three or four bullets before they run out and they can shoot anything anyway. They use no snipers, no explosives, no traps of any kind. They can't even hit you when they're next to you and wielding a knife. And you try to fight them in a decent manner, yet your avatar moves like a 60 year old man and even with the autoaim you still suck. And if you somehow get into the many separate levels where nothing make sense, you get a big cinematic that takes you out of it. And because the cinematic is in 4k or whatever, it feels like slow motion.

That, my friends, is the experience of watching JW4. The style that people have applauded in the first movie has turned into a demented caricature, the fight scenes are ridiculously bad, the actions of the characters make no sense at all, the world described makes no sense. Not even the tongue-in-cheek references to The Matrix don't hit, because you know that if you enjoyed that film, you're now over 40 and it makes you feel old. The film is three hours of irrelevance.

And if you are among the people who I can't understand that rated this film anything above boring, just watch the end credits scene. It destroys the little joy that you might have kept watching this.

Bottom line: So many talented people worked on this film. With them on board, I cannot imagine a worse outcome. It's not even funny, it's just sad.",0
"The first three John Wick films came in fairly quick succession, with only five years between the first and third chapters, each film trying to top the one before in terms of wild set pieces. For me, it all became a bit too much, the action rapidly becoming too frenetic and over-the-top. By Parabellum (part three), I had had enough.

I hoped that the four years between Parabellum and this fourth entry in the franchise had given me a big enough breather that I might be able to find new appreciation for the excessive mayhem. If anything, I found Chapter 4 even more tiresome: the fight scenes, as technically excellent as they are, simply don't know when to quit, and they're even more ridiculous than ever. Wick has been established as a semi-mythical being (Baba Yaga), seemingly impervious to pain and injury, meaning that the character is never in any real peril, which generates zero jeopardy or excitement. If anything, the relentless action scenes result in boredom, being mind-numbingly repetitive and far-fetched (the whopping 2 hours 49 minutes runtime doesn't help).

Director Chad Stahelski pushes plausibility way beyond breaking point with a protracted melee amidst the traffic around the Arc De Triomphe that somehow fails to attract the attention of the Paris gendarmerie; an even more dumb scene (in a film packed with dumb scenes) sees nightclub revellers continuing to dance while people are being shot and axed to death all around them. The final act - a duel between John and blind warrior Caine (Donnie Yen) - takes place outside the Basilica of Sacr?-Coeur de Montmartre at dawn, with not a single tourist or passerby to alert the authorities of what is occurring.

I've been known to enjoy comic-book action films that aren't exactly grounded in reality, but John Wick 4 seems to take place in an alternate universe where none of our rules apply. Since very little of what we see in this film can be believed, I definitely don't swallow the idea that John Wick is actually dead at the end (although I sincerely hope he is).

Those claiming that this is the best action film ever made have clearly never seen The Raid 2 (or any early John Woo film, or The Night Comes For Us, or Ong-Bak, or Born To Fight, or Eastern Condors or In The Line of Duty IV or.... well, you get the idea).",0
"By now you know what to expect from a John Wick movie. I thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so I was worried this could be disappointing. It's not. It's even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people. If you liked the first three movies, get your ass to the cinema. Yeah.",1
"What is all the raving about with this movie? I felt it lacked a decent storyline and was 2 hours and 35 mins of fighting while the remaining 10 or so minutes was acting.

The usual far too long fighting scenes where he does his usual MMA moves by getting the enemies head between his legs while he reloads his gun and shoots him the head.

For me it was at least an hour too long and could have been much shorter. The storyline was very weak and after such a long gap between this and John Wick 3 I am surprised it was written better.

I also have no idea why this review has to be a minimum go 600 characters?

Yes we.",0
"Most American action flicks released these days have poor screenplays and overuse computer-generated imagery. The John Wick franchise is one of the few exceptions, along with Mission Impossible. These franchises keep getting better with every entry. Hollywood can make action masterpieces, but Marvel has greater demand, so that's what we get most of. It's a shame.

The stunts and choreography are beyond impressive. Every artist involved does their job to perfection. Donnie Yen's performance is unbelievable. Not only does he fight great, but he also has to move like a blind man. Keanu Reeves is also very impressive. Keanu IS John Wick. Although there are a few scenes where his enemies stand by and wait for their turn to attack, it's easy to overlook because everything else is so great.

I can't fathom how anyone could choose to watch Ant-Man over John Wick. It's so fast-paced, and the choreography and stunts are mesmerizing and brutal. When the action breaks out, it's unbelievable. It's hard to explain -- you have to see it! Why watch a computer-generated ""superhero"" fly around when you can witness Reeves and Yen engage in a genuine and thrilling fight?",1
"I went to the cinema with great expectations. I have to admit that the photography is gorgeous, the locations are wonderful and the action sequences are well coordinated. However I feel that the true identity of this franchise was completely lost with this fourth chapter. The first two movies for me are the best because the stunts look more credible. ""Parabellum"" started to drop in quality, but it was still a solid flick. Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. I really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas, because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters, but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless.",0
"Ever since the original John Wick, the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.

John Wick is in a bad way as we open up. He's a man on a mission to get out from under the High Table with seemingly no end in sight. As he blazes a trail of bullets and corpses, those who have helped him or crossed his path find their own lives disrupted. With all hope lost, he soon finds the opportunity he's looking for when he discovers that he can put his life on the line for a chance to finally get out. The film brings with it a whole host of new characters, including Donnie Yen's Caine, Shamier Anderson's Tracker, Hiroyuki Senada's Shimazu, Rina Sawayama's (in a fantastic big screen debut) Akira, Scott Adkins' Killa, and of course Bill Skarsgard as new villain Marquis. It's a full cast, but everyone gets a chance to shine and could easily have their own films. Donnie Yen in particular demonstrates, once again, that he is a legend in this industry with several great fights of his own. But, of course, this is Keanu's film all the way and he gets to bring everything with him in the biggest film yet.

Covering four continents, we get fights on a massive set of stairs, fights in the middle of traffic, at one of the coolest looking hotels ever shown on screen, and so on. The fighting, of course, is exceptional, and it brings nunchakus, dogs, throwing stars, swords, guns, and so much more. It's everything a John Wick fan could want and, because these films are so technically proficient, you never feel like you're missing any of the action. Possibly the most creative choice is my favorite scene, one that combines a visually fantastic weapon with a shot choice that is unusual for action films of this nature, but the combination of these two pushes the scene into maybe one of action film's greatest scenes.

Admittedly, the story does leave a bit to be desired, but the minor complaints about these kinds of things pale in comparison to what we get. Hollywood has a new film to hold itself to and I have a feeling that (at least for me) action filmmaking will be judged by the standard this movie sets. It's such a blast, I already want to see it again.",1
"Stuntman turned writer/director Chad Stahelski struck gold with his 2014 surprise hit John Wick. It was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary Keanu Reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. Since then it's become THE action juggernaut franchise. Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.

One of the most surprising aspects of this particular entry, is the story being written as well as it is. Something that is hard to come by in the genre at times. Not saying the others in the franchise weren't but this is easily the best story diving deeper in the high table aspects as well as John Wick's true emotions . The rich characterization is also at its best with outstanding additions like Skaarsgard, and even more screen time for supporting greats like Fishburne to compliment the magnificent Reeves. RIP Lance Reddick. It's nice to have such substance amongst the endless high octane ballistic visuals.

Speaking of ballistic, this movie goes more all out than any I've seen for insanely well crafted choreographed shootout and fight scenes. Just when you thought you've seen it all, Stahelski/Reeves prove their action minds are ever evolving. These guys were born to make action movies together.

The extremely vibrant colors and plethora of locations is also a feast for the eyes. The sharp atmospheric imagery creates the ultimate backdrop for not only the action but also just the dialogue. The sound is also top notch and perfectly compliments the intensity. It's just an absolute sensory journey that you don't get in too many action films aside from the Wick genre.

Overall the limitless and outrageous action alone is nothing like we've seen before for the genre or just cinema in general . But also this rich unique story may only build Wick's timeless character for more films in the future which at this momentum will be welcomed.",1
"In this fourth installment of 8711's successful franchise, Keanu Reeves wearily drags himself from setpiece to setpiece, saying little, surviving the most ridiculous setups and finally achieves nothing.

The acting and writing of JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 are indeed the worst aspects of this film, and the exaggerated runtime of almost three hours doesn't help.

Try to remember John Wick's motivation to do all the things he does. What exactly is he actually doing, escpecially in this one? In addition to a lack of motivation, Chapter 4 is a remarkable retcon in the sense that John Wick could have ended the hunt for his person way earlier, thus making at least the last two installments redundant.

There's plenty of action here, sure, but it has been getting more and more unrealistic, and so you'll be in a situation where your suspension of disbelief says bye-bye, especially when you contrast the growing ridiculousness of the action with John Wick's decreasing vigour.

The plot has some toddler level plot holes and contrivances which are really distracting, yes, even in an action no-brainer like this. Keanu Reeves has maybe ten lines of dialogue in the whole movie. The Marquis is a nonsense character, just like Donnie Yen's Caine character. They just appear, but especially in Caine's case you're supposed to be emotional about it because he's basically John Wick's brother from another mother. We just never knew about him. Oh well.

This is the definition of a dumb movie for dumb people, and if you just want to enjoy some nice shots and over-the-top action (some of which is really nice) AND love Keanu Reeves, this is your jam. If you need a bare minimum of consistency and structure, you might feel cheated.",0
"In my opinion this is by far the worst movie of the franchise. It's just way too over the top. Everybody seems to have magical jackets now to stop the bullets.

Audience loved the dogs on the third one so that just lazily copied one here also but didn't bother to have any real cool scenes with it.

I'm happy they made John Wick 1 but since then every movie getting worse and worse. This one was already so bad that I regret spending any money to see it.

People shooting and dying in center of Paris but police doesn't seem to care.

John Wick getting shot, falling from great heights etc without any issues.",0
"John Wick: Chapter 4 picks up where Chapter 3: Parabellum left off. As has been the tradition in the sequels to this beloved martial arts action franchise the action starts from the very inception of the film's opening, and lasts until the curtain falls. JW4 is no exception to that rule. What it does do is improve on the prior installment, and solidify Keanu Reeves as the greatest martial arts action star of all time. If you don't accept that notion, then you must accept the fact that it solidifies Reeves and Director, Chad Stahelski, as the greatest martial arts action pairing of modern times.

The film opens in New York City, the home of the notorious Continental Hotel, and takes us to Osaka Japan, Paris France, and Berlin Germany. Each of those cities plays a major role in Reeves' quest to seek revenge against the High Table for the acts outlined in the prior films, and to seek his unconditional freedom from service to their order.

As the story unfolds we learn a bit more about Wick's past and upbringing than we did in the prior films, but not enough to get bogged down in. He uses his connections to his past, and the help of some old friends to find a path to level the playing field with the High Table's Emissary, The Marquis, played masterfully by Bill Skarsg?rd. Skarsg?rd makes the character memorable, and unique, with just a hint of Santino from the second installment.

Keanu Reeves as John Wick in John Wick 4. Photo Credit: Murray Close Hiroyuki Sanada and Reeves are reunited, having starred in 47 Ronin together. Sanada, as is always the case, is a strong presence in the film and makes the most of every scene he is in. He is a great addition to the film. The Osaka Continental fight scenes are groundbreaking, and among the best and most exciting in the entire series. This is some of the best fight and action choreography you will see; only topped by other scenes in this same movie.

Scott Adkins plays an unusually larger than life villain adeptly. The action and violence around the Berlin scenes involving his character, and his relationship to Reeves' past is fun to watch. Adkins is great to watch, whether starring in his own projects, or supporting, as he is here.

Shamier Anderson and Clancy Brown are new to the series and add great value. Anderson as a cunning assassin conflicted between admiration and greed. Clancy Brown is a strong presence and welcome replacement in the role of Adjudicator. I found Asia Kate Dillon's version of the same character to be the weakest part of the prior film, and, perhaps, of the whole series.

Mark Zaror, another great martial artist also has a prominent role as The Marquis' right hand man.

Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne return and offer more than just familiarity to the cast. Their roles are significant and meaningful.

Donnie Yen brings not only his skills as one of the finest martial arts movie stars in the world, but lends his presence as a charismatic and riveting figure. He plays the role of Caine with complexity and humanity that is a terrific mirror to Reeves' Wick; his friend and adversary by circumstance. This was a fantastic choice to take the Wick series to a new level.

Keanu Reeves continues to be engaging, empathetic, and dynamic in the role of John Wick. While the series has strayed a bit from the deeply reluctant anti-hero of the first film; we continue to cheer for the good guy caught up in a bad, bad world. One of the great strengths of the film is that Reeves and Stahelski are not afraid the let characters other than Wick shine. In fact, all of the stars of this one have their deeply profound and memorable moments in and out of the company of the main character. This really works.

As for the fight and action choreography. The stunt team at 87eleven continue to elevate the game. The film has three major, larger than life action sequences, that each, individually, outdo anything you will see in any other non John Wick movie. As mentioned previously, the Osaka and Berlin scenes were high energy, high body count affairs. They were complete with gun fights, sword mastery, gun play, and one of the best nunchuck displays you will ever see outside of a Bruce Lee movie. As for the scenes in Paris, at the Arc De Tripomphe, and on the Church steps, they are unlikely to be forgotten and, unlikely, to be topped for years to come, if ever. They are unique and exciting and violent feasts for the eyes.

While I have heard some say that John Wick: Chapter 4 is the best installment in the series I have to disagree, Nothing can top the original, in my opinion; however, Chapter 4 is a worthy installment for sure.

Will there be a Chapter 5 to the JohnWick saga? Remember, I said this was a Spoiler free review....

John Wick: Chapter 4 earns a 5 out of 5 star rating. It is worth seeing, and probably seeing again. I predict a significant box office gross for this one, and it is well deserved.",1
"No idea how the ratings are as high as they are. If you thought the first one was enjoyable but the 3rd one was bull, read on.

Just as the body count in the 3rd was ridiculous, this is even more absurd. Seems after coming up with the bullet proof suit the writers etc thought it a good idea to make sure everyone has one. These giant men sent to kill Wick all wearing suits, raising the jacket to protect their heads was a sight I found so funny. He's the best hitman on the world, how do we kill him? I know, we'll send a blind man!! Pathetic. And he can dodge bullets and he knows where everyone is. You could say it looked choreographed.

Now, about the DJ! They may have well cut the scenes directly from the Warriors. Better film, done better and that isn't a great film. For those of you who have never heard of the Warriors, go watch it. For those of you that have, skip this nonsense.",0
"Who needs a 2hr and 40 min action movie? No one. Yes the action was good, but repeats so many times that it becomes so boring. How can hundreds of assassins not kill one man? Answer, not possible, only in this movie and series. How many times could the dog man have killed Wick? Many. So no other assassin could? Why would the table head get Caine to kill Wick when he knows he won't. You can challenge the head to a duel as a rule, but they only assigned a head for the first time ever in this movie? WTF? And then the head can select a replacement? And he selects a blind man. All Wick had to do was to stand on the side or drop down and he wouldn't get shot. I think everyone knew Wick didn't shoot in the last round, except for the stupid head bad guy. This is not an action movie, it's a fantasy.",0
"Very much over rated. Repetitive, tiring and inauthentic fight choreography for 3 hrs straight. Unnatural and generic one liner filled script. No deep drama whatsoever. Just bland, perpetual killings till one is numb. Awful and fake seeming blood effects. Bland, cliched action hero.

All these characterize John Wick 4. These movies keep getting shallower with every sequel. The little soul the first two had is dead and buried here. I don't get the hype. John Wick has become like those generic action B movies with cliched scripts and characters. Not to forget the unlikable and uncharismatic addition, black guy with a dog. He was as dull as it gets.

Beautiful cinematography though. Loved some of the scenes except the CGI ones. A point for that I guess.",0
"I don't get why this movie has a high score, it doesn't deserve it. It's horrible, it doesn't make any sense, just killing people, but how can it be possible that those people after being shot many times, were able to fight as nothing happened to them? And the plot? Trying to kill John Wick in any way possible, period.

The worst thing is that they used some scenes from the movie The Warriors (1979), they didn't try to change anything, a black woman with nice big lips, talking on the radio, guiding the gangs with the purpose to chase and kill The Warriors. Same with John Wick, but of course with a modern technology. Shame on you! Didn't you have any better idea? You just copied an old movie that was much better than this one, and that soundtrack was great!

What a disappointment! It remembers somehow Kill Bill, but that movie was very good, this one is almost unacceptable!

I enjoyed the other movies about John Wick, they were very well done, and had a good plot. This time it seems like they didn't know what to write.

Not even the ending was good, is he really dead? We can't be sure, and probably there will be a John Wick 5, because something is missing. Anyway the fight against the thugs, before the last duel, was really bad... just a videogame.",0
"Indiana jones, terminator, predator, Jurassic park, the matrix, Jason bourne, etc. All amazing franchises but all share a common trait of having a bad or forgettable movie or 2 at some point. This is why john wick is the best action action movie franchise of all time; The movies just keep getting better and better. In john wick 4, when the action starts in Osaka Japan, it never let's up despite it's almost 3 hour running time. What I really enjoyed the most about JW4 is the cast of characters. Great villains and allies really keep this movie interesting as john trots the globe for 3 hours. The sound engineering, editing, direction, cinematography are excellent as always. The color schemes throughout this franchise (more john wick 2, 3 and especially 4) are such a treat for the eyeballs. Best action franchise EVER. And the shotgun fight in Paris with the ""dragons breath"" is the best action sequence I've probably ever seen in my life.",1
"May or may not count as a spoiler but John Wick pilled up more of a body count than Jason Vorhees sure different genre yet both great killing machines! Chad Staleski created such a great action extravaganza quad of films and one of my favorite trivia's he was the stunt doable for Keanu Reeves in the The Matrix back in the day; fast forward to 2014 they work together on one of the greatest action films of our generation. John Wick 4 is ultimate experience that is a must see I can't praise enough for how much fun it is.

I might get vibes for my thoughts I tried not to spoil it's obvious the combination of kill count has added up the rest left to the viewers, the action and writing is incredible for Chapter 4 that everyone involved deserves praise! I'd like to say too I own all the John Wick films and every Matrix, I'll get this in 4K when available.",1
So the second and 3rd john wick movies were blazing electric movies that took john wick to unbelievable levels. This 4th wick movie was water down and embaressingly woke with a corney addition to the wick roster of assasins. Kane somewhat saved the movie at times but the movie felt vague and amibiguous with endless fighting and wayy over the top action the that took wick to a level of absurdity and crossed over to ridiculous and clever or as cool as part 3. Thr crafty skills wernt on display in the same they were in the last 3 movie outside of one glorious overhead camera shot of wick blistering through a apartment building. This scene alone bumped this film up into the above average relm.,0
"I thought I remembered a less caricatural Keanu Reeves (""Yeaaah..."", ""I'll stay..."") and a more Nobody (2021)-like franchise but JW:C4 really felt like a bad ""kingsman"" mixed with an equally lousy Hotel Artemis (2018).

And why the sempiternal clich? of the Black supporting character, playing the janitor what's more, and being the first ""good guy"" to die for absolutely no reason?

Ok, let's review the clich?s, then:
Story? So clich?...
Cultural misrepresentation? Soo clich?...
Characters? Sooo clich?...
The sketchbook? Soooo clich?...
The dialogues? More than clich?...
The Bow-Vs-Assault-Riffle fight choreography? More more than clich?...
The Sumo-Vs-SWAT-guys fight choreography? More more more than clich?...
The Blind-Guy-Vs-Wall chorstumbleography? Unbearably ridiculous...
The Bullet-Proof-Tan-Business-Suit-Vs-Tiny-Knives fight choreography? More than unbearably ridiculous...
The Handgun-Vs-The-World fight choreography? Boring...",0
"...all at the same time. This hybrid comic book-video game has a stupid plot, worse than average acting, and fight scenes that are so poorly done you don't mind going to the bathroom. Don't get me wrong. I loved John Wick 1. Thought #2 was OK. Then came #3., It showed they were out of imagination and should have stopped with #2. Now with #4 they show that they are not artists or creatives but merely clowns looking for as buck.

It's not completely without value, which is why it got a 2 instead of a 1. The photography is beautiful and they have a dog as a hero. The rest is worthless. Save the money and the time.",0
"Unpopular Opinion - John Wick 4 is a below average movie.

I loved all 3 John wick movies, but this one is more likely a conclusion of John wick series, So the fight scenes are boring and repetitive. Previous movies had different types of action and stunt choreographies. This one has long same fights , might be in different locations.

As far Keanu goes, his close up shots or his face doesnt appear in the movie atleast for a half time. John wick past movies had few dialogues but it had an impact, 4 has same few dialogues but it was very plain and flat.

Ending is Spoiler - John Wick Dies (or not) shown in a way that if there is a possibility of a sequel , there can be.

May stunts shots and its accuracy is totally gone, we can clearly see that where the gun is aimed and it just went like a paper plane. Even with the so-called Coat Armour, some pistol shots were directly aimed at Head / Leg which was again repelled with the armor which is in the shoulder.

The sad thing is this is the same with Balayya movies, but when it directed and taken in Hollywood people go crazy!

An average movie 6/10.",1
"In a world where movie sequels seem to be loathed even before they are released, the 'John Wick' series has remained remarkably consistent and well received. In fact all three of the first films have the same IMDb rating of 7.4/10 and I noticed recently that I gave them all the same rating of 8/10. Incredibly, I think 'John Wick: Chapter 4' is the best the series has to offer. This movie was a wild ride.

I was a little disappointed when I first saw the runtime for this one was going to be almost 3 hours. I find that is becoming a tough runtime for a lot of films to justify. This film does it with no trouble. The pacing is so incredibly fast that the 3 hours pass by in no time. I remember looking down at my watch early in the film thinking maybe 20-25 minutes had gone by and almost an hour had already passed.

A large reason for this is the action sequences. When an action sequence starts in this film buckle in, because it is going to go for nearly 20-30 minutes and be non-stop craziness the for the duration.

The action sequences in this film are perfectly shot as they always are in this series. Lovely, wide camera angles so we can see every thing that happens and know that it isn't all being edited to look this way. These people are actually doing these things.

As always with these films you need to go in a rather incredible suspension of belief. Wick is nearing super-human level at this point. It doesn't matter how many cars you hit him with or how high the building he falls off is, he'll be back and fighting again 10 seconds later. It's best to switch your brain off at these points I have found.

Finally, I loved the main villain in this movie played excellently by Bill Skarsg?rd. He was everything a villain should be. Calm and seemingly in control, menacing and easy for the audience to hate and root against.

This film was a blast from start to finish. 9/10.",1
"We all walk into John Wick 4 with expectations of what we will see, standards we refuse to lower and excitement already creeping in. From the first second it engages you, no hesitation, no quarter. And it's only the beginning. I read somewhere that a reviewer had said that there wasn't a wasted moment in this film and I watched it questioning the validity. They weren't wrong. Each conversation has a purpose, each scene makes a point. From the gunfight samurai scene in Tokyo to the phosphorus gunfight shot from above in Paris, the action doesn't diminish. Normally a sequel is ""lesser"" but John Wick 4 simply builds onto the quadrilogy. It makes sense, it continues the story and the characters get all the more interesting.

I can tell you right now, if the phosphorus gunfight scene doesn't impress you (which it will), the Paris traffic carnage scene is brilliant. I can't say I have ever seen someone do full continuous 360 drifting in a muscle car either :D

I know Keanu said that Chad Stahelski and himself were taking a long break from the John Wick series but should we have seen the end, it ended on a note I feel we could live with. If they can find another story that will build onto the John Wick series then so be it but if not, I truly left the movie happy and felt it was done.

Don't leave until after the credits are done. Trust me, it's not finished.",1
"JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 (2023) ***1/2 Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, Clancy Brown, Bill Skarsgard, Donnie Yen, Aimee Kwan, Hiroyuki Sanada, Shamier Anderson, Rina Sawayama. Reeves' indestructible titular assassin returns in full form in the latest (and arguably best) of the fast-hitting, brutally violent action franchise with the marker on his head increased by new foe Skarsgard (oily good at being the villain) and the countdown to his demise imminent worldwide. The set pieces are displayed with cunning skill and scary accuracy with pressure point precision and unnerving balletic grace. A *chef's kiss* for the wherewithal overall and a genre fan's wet dream fulfilled. It kills! (Dir: Chad Stahelski)",1
"Listen, this movie was far from as good as the others and had very little realism to it compared to the others. Numerous times John falls from like 4 stories up and gets up and walks it off. He also gets hit by cars numerous times and simply just walks it off. He also falls down 222 steps and gets up and walks it off. Where is the realism here?

Also, the acting was incredibly bad. Like really really bad. Laurence Fishborne going over the top and Keanu not saying much, but when he does he makes himself sound like he's having a stroke.

Adding the black assassin dude simply as the diversity hire was a weird choice. Like seriously, he was the only black dude. The dude was a complete wild card that you had no idea whose side he was on. He was trying to kill John, but also trying to save him? Also, he had a dog to help him. Didn't Halle Berry have the exact same gimmick in the last movie that did the same trick of going for the nuts?

And where was John's motivation for all of this? Why was he in Japan? Why did he kill the High Table person? Why wasn't this Marques person introduced sooner? Why was a blind assassin 20x better than any of the other assassins? And lastly, why did John go through allllll of that crap just to die at the end? To protect Winston? The dude who shot him off roof?

Overall, there was only a couple of good parts to the movie. Nothing that the other 3 movies hadn't done before.",0
"Ok, so I got back from seeing this entry yesterday night. I'm writing this review in the early hours after midnight as the film went on for a good whopping 2 hours & 39 minutes!! But we'll get to that in a bit...! Anyway, I was looking forward to this film since John Wick 3's release back in 2019 & this film has had a bit of a troubled history of getting pushed back until it finally got its March 2023 release. I must admit I was a bit skeptical, but, was looking forward to this as the John Wick films are ace, but this film was a bitter disappointment...!

The film sees John Wick, who from the events of the last film, has a price on his head which is increasing more than ever. The lethal unstoppable force of nature assassin now must fight against the High Table Global as he seeks out & fights the most deadly assassins players of the underworld from Paris to New York to Berlin to Japan. Will John Wick finally meet his match!?

Whoa...! Where do I start!? I found the film for starters to be too long!! At a whopping 2 hours & 39 minutes this film is way, way, way too long! The pacing... whoa! Don't get me started! I was willing to be tolerant & forgive the pacing, but when it got to the final leg it took the absolute puss & started to test my nerves! The story is so weak I had to look this film up in order to get what the plot was, again, another sign that the film was going to be bad, the first was the runtime, which I knew was going to be bad from the word go!

The film took a while to get going which was a pain, but it got there I guess! The fights were good, as with the John Wick films typically are, not to mention funny & brutal! But all things considered, it got repetitive fast & annoying especially near the end as I just mentioned! The story scenes were alright as with the villains & bad guys though again, it got repetitive & irritating.

The realism was stretch beyond its limits here in this film. John Wick fell from a great height on a metal pipe which looked to have (& lets be honest here) would've snapped his back like a tooth pick! John got hit by a car 5 times yet never suffers any bad injuries or dies! Yet a few bullet wounds finally kill him at the end (another downer of this film which I'll touch up on in a second!), the fight scenes in the night club where only a few people stood there shocked while about 95% just kept on dancing! Face palm! There were several other scenes which made you just think ""dafuq!?""

The lead up to the end was annoying! Just when you thought John Wick was going to go to the Stand Off with the blind villain, there was more fight scenes! Don't get me wrong, these fights where good, but annoying & held the film up for a good 20 minutes before the finale which to say the least, was anti climatic! The scene on the 122 steps was irritating & made you just scoffs in frustration when John got kicked down those steps which for a couple of seconds in its self, dragged & felt & looked comical! It's like getting so far in a mission in Grand Theft Auto V then dying & reverting back to the latest checkpoint where you have to start all, over, again!! The same feelings of that (from experience) where felt for me in this film from that scene!

Then of course, after John Wick killing 180 odd people (or more, I lost count obviously) he finally dies! What!? Like James Bond in that god awful Bond Film of 2021 No Time To Die!? Can't be!? What a poor show! Anyhow, to give you guys some perspective on how long this is in comparison to the rest of the films in the franchise! Without credits as they don't count!

John Wick (2015) - 1 hour 30 minutes John Wick 2 (2017) - 1 hour 50 minutes John Wick 3 (2019) - 1 hours 57 minutes John Wick 4 (2023) - 2 hours 39 minutes

Notice how the films got long & long with each entry...!

Overall, this ranks as they absolute worst of the franchise! I was willing to forgive the poor pacing & overly bloated runtime, but it got on my nerves too much to bare & when I saw that John Wick died!? Nope, that was it for me! The editing was poor with this film whoever edited this needs class in editing as this was bad beyond belief! The pacing also was poor combined with the bad editing! The fights were good, but too drawn out, long & annoyingly repetitive! The ending was both bad & anti climatic! How this film has 95% on RT is beyond me! But then what do I expect...! This ranks as the worst John Wick film in the franchise! With word of a female spin-off coming out (which will be bad), I've lost hope in this franchise! Let's hope John Wick 5 (if ever) redeems this kak entry!

4/10 & that's generous considering!",0
"Delivers a best high octane action thriller from the franchise .

Pros - There was bit let down in JW3 , but they came back with a banger JW4 and delivered one of the best actions of all time . Stunt choreography , Camera work , editing and heart pumping BGMs were totally bonkers . There were many prolonged action sequences through out the movie , each of them never fails to deliver some thrill and adrenaline rush . Besides from action set pieces , JW4 well contributed in the world building and this whole tetralogy done a good job in World building & character establishments , I hope it will be well used in its upcoming spin off series and movies . Cast did great job , especially Keanu Reeves and Donie Yen were great .

Cons - Few silly logical mistakes that you can't ignore .

Overall , to the action lovers and John wick fans out there don't miss out to watch it on big screen . Must watch . Highly recommended .",1
"This is laughably bad. My second hand embarrassment threw up its hands and died of shame.

I adore Keanu but my god he failed at even the most basic fight choreography; although the fault is shared equally with the script writers, the editing team, and the director who all decided we needed almost 3 hours of whatever this was.

If anyone believes that a half bent over John Wick could kill 100s of super trained assassins all by himself, then have I got a bridge to sell you in Laos.

Look, KR is like a 100 yrs old and should have long retired from doing any film that requires hand-to-hand combat.

Note to Keanu's agent: get this man into a zombie/apocalypse movie, ffs.",0
"That lasted 169 minutes? I had no idea. The time just flew right by.

Chad Stahelski does not pull any punches (or engage the safety) at any time in this gun-fu epic. Combat scenes are not moments so much as they are entire acts. The amount of stunt choreography that everybody had to synchronize to was rather incredible, and they continue to find more ways to entertain us with kills, kill types, use of weapons, locations, teamwork, etc. I caught myself smiling for minutes on end several times while watching it.

Of course though, as I said, they really lean into it. I'm sure this has been true of previous films as well, but it is very apparent that John Wick should virtually die in every scene that he is in. Whether it is how he is attacked or how they fail to attack him at the right times, he goes at every foe like the bear in The Revenant with full adrenaline and no signs of slowing down no matter what he is hit by. And again, I think if you look hard enough you will find enemies who have clear shots and choose not to take them because of plot armor, but you can forgive it enough if you're rewarded with a longer take or overall longer action sequence. What I really loved was how many of these scenes took place at night with dazzlingly lit environments all around, and the music in every scene kicks as much *** as what you see on screen. I had pondered over why John Wick doesn't have a video game yet, but if they ever make one I have decided I'd like one of those top-down shooter games (similar to The Hong Kong Massacre, and if not maybe like the GTA:SA MP rampage style).

I acknowledge this franchise for what it is now, but I still pine for some of the missing components that I don't know if it'll ever be able to bring back. After watching John Wick, fun as it was, I found myself interested in seeing a prequel when he was the Baba Yaga in his prime, taking missions rather than being hunted. Even still, at least in that movie he was absolutely feared. In Chapter 2, I still found him heavily respected, but it was in that movie that I realized there would probably be a repetitive formula to the narrative and movie/action structure (which still has yet to break). In Chapter 3, there only lived assassins and they would go after him without hesitation, which did is not how I felt the world breathed the first time around. They continue down this path in Chapter 4, while opening the universe more to different characters breeding their own kind of loyalty. They are all insanely fun to watch, and you see the cogwheels of the John Wick universe spinning with the future Continental television show and the Ballerina movie spinoff. Where they remain faulty though is even with the existence of civilians during fight scenes, they act as droning NPC's like nothing is happening around them, or they aren't there whatsoever. It is clear that this is not our world that this movie takes place in, but rather a parallel one.

I mentioned the introduction of new characters in this world, and you can't not bring up Donnie Yen when talking about them. He steals each and every scene that he is in, and it's crazy because you wonder how a character like his could thrive in such a world but you absolutely believe it when you watch it. I will absolutely take more of him and Rina Sawayama. She isn't featured as much, but she makes use of every second that she is in front of the camera. There are plenty of others (such as the great Hiroyuki Sanada), but the point remains that Wick is relegated to this greater universe with characters who-good, bad, or for themselves-are ones we can actually root for in any fight. Keanu Reeves is understandably less nimble at his age than the others (and it's either bad acting or he really has taken on this John Wick role in his line delivery to hilarious new heights), but he and Stahelski have found a groove that still makes him the most impenetrable force around, to the point that I go back and watch the action scenes in The Matrix Resurrections and wonder what happened there. I didn't love one particular character in their big fighting moment(s), but they go for versatility and I have to give them that much.

March has had an incredible run of theatrical films, and John Wick: Chapter 4 is no different. You will lean forward during the action which there is plenty, and if I'm one to go off of you will not feel the runtime. There is an end credits scene as well if you're able to stay for a moment longer. I would love to go back and see this one again.",1
"HORRIBLE movie. I love John Wick. I mean I wouldn't pay to see one, but I love the series none the less. Even liked the third one even though the ending blew baby chunks. All the 10s and 9s scores are so damn fake it's hilarious. IMDB is a joke. Someone needs to start a real movie database and weed out the fake high scores, it's as ridiculous as John Wick 4. He walks away from every major injury or collision or building fall. Then he passes away from flesh wounds. What nonsense. The whole plot is nonsense. The fights scene are so boring. I got up to make a sandwich twice. Just the typical 100 judo throws and same shots to head. Numerous coup de grace's. I feel sorry for anyone who paid for this nonsense.",0
Quite possibly the best action movie of the decade. It's only 2023. This one is currently number one. Terminator 2 is the best action movie of all time. The raid 2 is the best action sequel of all time. This movie is the best 4th movie in a series of all time. Props to lethal weapon 4 as well. Keanu is a bad ass ok. He moves a little slow in the beginning but by the time the second half comes along he moves like a martial arts madman. That being said.. the nunchucks he incorporates into his character in that first half is brilliant. The set pieces in this are absolutely fantastic. The music is perfectly incorporated as well. There were a few nods to some classic flicks too. Movie buffs will catch them.,1
"My expectations for John Wick: Chapter 4 was high, these films have become some of my favorite action films of all time, and I can say this without giving it a second thought how it met those expectations. The thugs and easy obstacles are nothing new, except for how they too have ballistic suits like our protagonist. But this Chapter begins with a recovered Baba Yaga who's out for blood. Actors and returning characters along with Keanu Reeves as John Wick is Laurence Fishburne as the Bowery King, Ian McShane as Winston Scott, and Lance Reddick (in one of his final roles) as Charon. New roles which I loved was Donnie Yen as Caine: a blind High Table assassin and an old friend of John Wick.

Bill Skarsg?rd as the Marquis Vincent de Gramont: a powerful member of the High Table whose position is challenged by John Wick. Hiroyuki Sanada as Shimazu Koji: the manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel and an old friend of John Wick. It also stars Shamier Anderson, Rina Sawayama and Scott Adkins.

The premise goes like this: John Wick uncovers a path to defeating The High Table. But before he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe and forces that turn old friends into foes.

Let's dig deeper into the story and what sequences I liked the most, I have a weak spot for samurai movies and the Osaka Continental offers just that. Brilliant choreography for each character, good guys like bad guys. With Hiroyuki Sanada being as brilliant as ever! Also showing off Donnie Yen's retired blind assassin. It's always nice to see a new Continental and this one sure felt special, you notice what friendship John Wick and Shimazu Koji has. The action sequence was great! But my favorite city and action sequences are found in Paris, it has the biggest importance to the story, it brought so many memorable moments. It shows why Keanu Reeves was and is right to lead this franchise. Paris is also the city where Marquis Vincent de Gramont is located and he becomes the highest-ranking member of The High Table during this film. Bill Skarsg?rd holds one of the strongest performances in the film as the Marquis. Keanu Reeves holds the best though, maybe not the best dramatic performance but certainly overall performance as he does his own stunts alongside everything else, and the stunts are incredible. Donnie Yen was great and possibly even one of the best things of the movie, both his knowledge in martial arts but also his character which I loved. The performance that surprised me was Shamier Anderson as the mysterious bounty hunter, it's a great character that they could do so much with and I can easily say the same for Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada's characters. One of the final action sequences was all in a one take, except for a quick cut before moving back to the one take. It was shot with a camera above, letting us see everything happening from above and moving with John Wick as he fires inside an abandoned building.

Chad Stahelski truly directed an action film that'll be remembered for decades, his direction in both the action and more dramatic scenes are all brilliant. There's so many fight sequences in this film, small like big, all directed and shot brilliantly. The screenplay was done by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch, I don't have any problem with it, it's good and for a Wick film it holds the same quality. The movies aren't about the best writing in Hollywood, it's about what happens on the screen, blood being spilled. Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard returned to compose the score for the film, after doing so for the previous three films. Like Shay Hatten had done too.

I have read various of critics and some people complaining about the length, Chapter 4 has a runtime of 169-minutes. Its long, full of beautiful looking shots that does nothing to the story, only to create atmosphere and suspense where it succeeds. There are scenes that you could easily trim, yes, but I still found the length to be perfect. I want to see the 3 hour 49 minute version just because of how great the film was, but the theatrical version is magnificent. Chapter 4 is all about tying up loose ends, to finally find peace and freedom. It's a long road to that point, Chad uses the film's length for just that, to tell a bigger and deeper story than a simple story. More run time also means for more action sequences!

This might be the best film of the four, both action and drama, also most beautiful in regards of the camera work and cinematography. Dan Laustsen truly knows his craft, making each scene absolutely mesmerizing to look at! I loved every second of it, when I saw it at the cinema, a woman (a mother) sat beside the person I was there with and said how brutal it was... She was five minutes in and the first action scene had only just started. Jokes aside, John Wick: Chapter 4 has some of the franchise's best action sequences and Keanu Reeves at his best. Like his role in The Matrix, John ""Baba Yaga"" Wick will be another role he'll be remembered for. This was an incredible film, one of the best I've seen in awhile.",0
"John Wick series have always been over-the-top action / thriller joyrides more focused on dazzling you with visceral, expertly choreographed action sequences than trying to tell the most coherent stories about stylish assassins. Director Chad Stahelski's John Wick: Chapter 4 is no exception. And it abundantly delivers on the franchise's hallmarks - snazzy guns, lovable dogs, and one very haggard man in black. John Wick: Chapter 4 isn't a movie you casually sit down to watch apropos of nothing. It's a commitment, both in terms of how long it is and in how invested you really have to be in the idea of John Wick for the film to be engaging. To its credit, John Wick: Chapter 4 does an admirable job of leaving open possibilities for a future filled with stories of some of the movie's new supporting characters. It comes as a pleasant surprise given how much time this story spends trying to remind you that Wick is the baddest man in town. It's a movie that's meant to be watched loud and big. Remember ! John Wick has fought hard for it.",1
"Sitting through the nearly 3 hours of this opus, I can't say that I didn't get my money's worth. But the ride was so bombastic, dark and mumbly that at a certain point it was like being stuck on a roller coaster ride that I've gone through 10 times and gradually sunk deeper and deeper into my chair.

What is this movie about? Long were the days of the original John Wick, where it felt nicely paced. A short film extended into a feature but still retained an independent film vibe. Those days are gone. When the original Wick came out, they kept it simple...man seeks revenge on some punks who killed his dog given to him from dead wife. That plot alone is laughably simple. Yet it worked. Perhaps it was the zeitgeist at the time. But this series falls into the VERY same trap they all do. Bigger everything. And that wasn't the case. The Table is a mysterious group that had slick lingo with caricatures of other movies that made you feel something familiar. The call center with its tattoo'd Betties seemed so out of a Jean Pierre Jeunet film like ""City Of Lost Children"" It was unique in the sense that it embraced its steam punk comic book feel. Then it imploded into ridiculous feats of inhuman strength. And a total lack of logic. Police apparently don't exist in John Wick Paris. Ugh.

Also, the stunts are great but after (I would calculate) an hour of the same aerobatics, leg locks, tosses and gun shot to head, I grew tired. Made me want to scream to move on. Yes, it has a visceral release to a general audience (I heard a few in my theater clap with approval. But also consider there was one mentally challenged one in a wheel-chair, the other was an elderly lady who was talking through the movie). The original Wick made you really feel the pain of its villains. And made it satisfying. Here, when he goes room to room sweeping with a fire launching shotgun, I wanted to REALLY cheer. It felt flat. Well done, but something was missing. That's what this entire movie felt like. Something missing. Keanu is obviously an expert gun handler now and does hand to hand combat well, but man was it getting old fast.

Bill Skarsgard, as the villain, seems to be tapping into Rami Malek from ""No Time To Die"" He's a meglamaniac whose ties to this under ground assassin league is anchored to funding it. Did they ever explain why this society even exists? Probably not. I was bored. Also, Ian MacShane's Manager role is exhaustively pedestrian.. I mean, tiresome tropes come out of his mouth as if it were the first time hearing it.

Everyone is desperate to be cool in this flick. Finally, the Donnie Yen character. Okay, a LOT cannot be forgiven. He is dragged into wanting to kill Wick because of threats to his family. Yet, he kills everyone BUT Wick and yet gets to survive. Here's the problem. It telegraphed it when he would incapacitate the guys in the kitchen of the Osaka branch. Instead of violently kill them. That's how you can tell he wasn't going to be a bad dude.

Oof. They add an extra assassin who totes along a dog. That dog was getting on my nerves. And I love dogs. This dog seemed to be trained to sick men's privates. For some reason. After the 5th go at this gag, it was dead in the water.

This is a subpar entry into the series. Though they kill off Wick in this flick (yeah right) he see some future installment with say...the daughter of the Osaka branch who seemed to have projected a future conflict with Wick in the future.

This series will never end as long as simple minded audiences exists. All Sound And Fury Adds Up To Nothing.",0
"Just how much cash can you get out of a cash cow? As the John Wick producers know that's plenty of dough but with each iteration the movies become ever more flabby and contrived. The Hollywood formula has been employed; copy a previous success adding ever more crash bang and wollop and of course stretching the whole thing out to a dreary 3 hour run time. But of course Hollywood misses the point, yet again. What made the original Wick movie interesting was the character's struggle to make a new life only to be dragged back into the criminal underworld. Granted it's an interesting and novel criminal underworld but now it's the world of John Wick which is the focus, not Wick himself. Time to call it a day.",0
"The bad: it lasts too long. A whopping 2 hours and 45 minutes. Some of the fighting scenes stretch out over 5 to 15 minutes of CONTINEOUS fighting. But after having watched over 2 hours of fighting already, I definitely began to long for it to end.

The good: the fighting scenes are pretty good though. I was wondering if they could still come up with some new and interesting fighting choreography and they succeeded at that quite well. There are even quite a few comical fighting stunts included. Nice!

All in all not a bad sequel. If it werent for the much TOO long duration I would rate this nr 4 sequel better / higher as the nr 3 edition.

Nothing beats the original first edition of John Wick though, because THAT first edition was not only contineous action but also cared about the CHARACTERS. Unfortunately all the sequels were more and more focussed on solely the figthing scenes, which kinda bored me in the end.

Nr 4 is highly overrated. I suspect because of artificial ""managing"" of the Imdb ratings. This movie is never worthy of 8 stars (ridiculous). 6 stars at best. But because I got bored at the end I will only rate it 5 stars...",0
"The fight scenes were terrible. Looked absolutely fake. This movie series should stop. Turning into Fast and Furious. The people at times were waiting for Keanu to turn around before throwing the slowest fakest punches ever. The punches Keanu was throwing didn't look remotely real. The nunchucks scenes were crazy bad. This movie is not good.

It is so stupid that you have to write so much in order to leave a review. There is no need to write a paragraph in order to review a movie. Especially one as trash as John Wick 4.

Crazy people acting like this movie is good. By far the worst of the franchise.",1
"Henchmen just standing there, waiting to get hit, reacting to things that didn't hit them, people in the club just doing the same dance even while people are being killed right in front of them, the cars in traffic keeps moving even while people are getting killed, cars are crashing and bullets are flying, but nope.. traffic just keeps on going. I can't unsee any of it.

It looks painfully unnatural compared to how well the previous 3 films handled the fighting.

There's a ton of wasted movement and shot decisions based on making a scene look ""pretty"" rather than ""good.""

I know they can do better. I've seen it.

A couple cute twists of the story doesn't really carry the rest of the film, but it was at least still entertaining.",1
"Sheez Louise these are getting awful. They know the audience wants to see a conclusion; but like Lucy holding the football, they'll keep yanking it away forever. They're trying so hard to keep upping the level, but the fights are just cliche now. The NPCs all swing so slow, hold their hands out for so long, Ian McShanes new teeth are horrendously white, I'm a huge fan of his but it's just unnatural. Almost like Rudy Giuliani. The Bug eyed dude from the remake of IT is awful as a Frenchman? Belgian? Whatever his accent is supposed to be, it's bad. Donnie Yen's blind swordsman is amusing but still cheesy. Nobody? Who is this dude and why is he even in this movie??? Was there some contract requirement that said ""we must have a dude with a dog in this film""??? Please just finish the series and stop making more. Oh wait they just announced JW 5 in pre-production.

Can I jade my 12 dollars back???

The only GOOD part was the throwback to Warriors, and even that just seemed bizarre and completely out of place.",0
"How this managed to sneak out of the editor's room at almost three hours in length is beyond me; I'm also confused as to how the script was so bland, with Keanu's repetition of ""Yeah"" in the same monotone voice and plain expression becoming something of a drinking game legend at this point.

Do you value your time? This movie trashes it completely and does away with respected conventions. In no world does this movie need to exist, but if it does, it needs to be tighter, and with better direction for the cast.

Most of our enjoyment came from Donnie Yen's performance., and each time Ian McShane opened his mouth enough to show us his ridiculous veneers.",0
"This was just like watching my nephew play a videogame for 3 hours straight. I normally like action movies, and don't mind the hole plots, the exaggerations ++ as long as you get involved with the characters and it's funny. This had little humor, and it was so over exaggerated the the point I just wanted everyone to die (even John, and he should have died 1,5 hours earlier). I was so mad when he fell down the stairs for the 20th time, I just wanted the movie to end. No fun to watch when the main characters supposedly have superpowers and could have won the WW2 all by them selves. But I guess people don't expect much from movies anymore.",0
"Right off the bat, the second scene where he is chasing three guys on a horse in the desert (why? Who are they?) and then kills The Elder who's just sitting there, with very little fanfare in the middle of nowhere, no protection or even servants, I was immediately underwhelmed. This is supposed to be like a big deal, yet it felt meaningless.

After that, it's just a bunch of barely credible fight scenes, over and over and over and over... All with convenient bulletproof clothing, and apparently none of these trained killers and thousands of bullets can hit the man's head. The cream of the crop is at the Arc de Triomphe, where he gets hit by four cars no less and just walks it off each time. Or where he jumps 4-5 stories high and slams his body basically head first on a parked car, and just walks that off too. Or when he falls down 222 stairs and walks THAT off.

In the end, this is all just a cheap video game, where your character goes from set piece to set piece and has to shoot his way out; but in God mode.

This thing is getting great reviews all over. What a low point we've come to.",0
"Repetitive Action, Lacks Story.

The movie has some great action seens but it's too repetitive and lacks reality completely. There's no story and the high table, just wants to keep giving John chances to be a free guy over and over again. Expected more from this movie tbh.

ChatGPT Title: ""John Wick 4: Explosive Action with a Repetitive Plot""

Word Count: 709

""John Wick 4"" is the highly anticipated sequel to the action-packed franchise that has captivated audiences with its adrenaline-fueled sequences. While the film delivers on its promise of spectacular action scenes, it falls short in terms of originality and narrative depth. Despite its flaws, ""John Wick 4"" manages to entertain fans of the series, but fails to live up to the high expectations set by its predecessors.

Undeniably, the movie showcases some truly impressive action sequences. From intense gunfights to jaw-dropping stunts, the film's choreography and execution are impeccable. The fight scenes are meticulously crafted, and Keanu Reeves once again proves his dedication to his role as the lethal assassin John Wick. The combination of Reeves' physicality and the expertly designed action sequences creates a thrilling cinematic experience that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.

However, the film's biggest flaw lies in its repetitiveness. While the previous installments of the franchise offered a fresh take on the action genre, ""John Wick 4"" feels like a rehash of familiar territory. The plot fails to bring anything new to the table, resulting in a sense of predictability that diminishes the overall impact of the film. The narrative lacks the complexity and depth that fans have come to expect from the series, leaving much to be desired.

One of the disappointments of ""John Wick 4"" is the lack of a compelling story. The film relies heavily on the established formula of John Wick facing insurmountable odds and battling countless adversaries. The absence of a coherent and engaging plot prevents the movie from reaching its full potential. While the franchise has never been known for its intricate storytelling, this installment takes it to a new level by prioritizing action over substance.

Another aspect that hampers the film's impact is the portrayal of the High Table. In previous movies, the enigmatic organization added an element of intrigue and mystery to the narrative. However, in ""John Wick 4,"" the High Table becomes a monotonous antagonist whose only purpose seems to be providing John Wick with repeated chances for redemption. This narrative choice not only diminishes the stakes but also makes the world feel less grounded and realistic.",0
"John Wick 1 was the best imo. The story was somewhat coherent and drew attention. There was plenty of action that was exciting without being over-the-top ridiculous.

Next up in John Wick 2, the story was still somewhat coherent and though some scenes started to become a bit nonsensical(tons of assassins and no police etc), it was still a solid movie and easy to follow.

In John Wick 3 everything took a nosedive into utter nonsense. Part 4 expanded on this with nothing but lots of ridiculous wild nonstop fights. Typical Hollywood cash grabs devolved into absolute boring and ridiculous rubbish.",0
"Come on buys and girls: a solid 8 on imdb for his piece of crap? What an unbelievable dumb movie with a stupid story line although the previous 3 movies have the same problem. But the action and killing in this movie is over the top and a certain point boring because of the amount of attackers and John survives evrything. Unfortunately because after an hour I was only thinking: my God, kill the guy and get over with this movie. There is no humor in the movie, the ""story-line"" makes no sense at all and all the action is way over the top. It is not entertaining but only annoying and I really hope the guy is dead, will stay dead and no John Wick part 5. What a waste of more than 2,5 hours....",1
"Where do I start ? After fighting & killing about 400 blokes he gets run over by buses cars throws himself out of a 3rd story window onto a VW van , gets thrown down 300 concrete steps and yea you guessed it .... Get up and carries on light nothing happened !

It's insulting your intellect to even imagine him doing all this ? On top of that there's a blind man fighting 100 + assailants who doesn't get stabbed , shot , or even knocked out ?? who writes this nonsense? I love Reeves but this time it's too over the top to be real , embarrassing again and again ! Don't bother paying to see this crap.",0
"So I like the John Wick series as much as the next guy but this is just lazy. There are a couple of things that we need to address here.

First the story has gotten very VERY stale. Like to the point of where if you removed the story, it wouldn't have mattered, at all.

Second as where in the first movie there was some pretty damn good choreography, in this installment I literally watched MULTIPLE scenes of guys standing around waiting for 1 guy to go down so they could pretend to jump in. And no, this wasn't like a behind the scenes take.

And the final insult is the actual fighting itself, there are just times when for no reason the person he's fighting just sits there, they aren't knocked out, they aren't dead, they're just waiting for him to get his gun, load some bullets, go for a coffee, and then shoot them. It actually pains me to watch this garbage be pawned off as a top tier movie.

This is when you guys should stop this series, lets be honest you should have stopped it at the last movie, but ok, you had to give it a proper ending. News flash, this isn't it.",0
"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.

I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.

Highlights:

Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me ball. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.

Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.

The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.

Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.

Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.

One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.

I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.

9/10 for me.",1
"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.

While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.

The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.

Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.

""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.

Best Character: Drax Best Quote: ""She is to us."" Best Scene: Infiltrating Orgocorp Best Piece of Score: ""I Love You Guys""",1
"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.

At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.

The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",1
"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.

I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.

The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.

At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",1
"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.

Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.

Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.

I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them. Oh and I forgot to mention it's pretty funny.",1
"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.

Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.

Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel. Give Gunn credit for bidding a loving farewell with both barrels blazing, even if it does close the books on this series, at least temporarily.",1
"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",1
"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel. Trust me this is a great film.",1
"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.

Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.

Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.

In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",1
"Depressing, dark, with lame humour sprinkled in with ill fitting music jammed in at random. I can't recognize anything ""marvel"" about this. The tone, weak writing and CGI jammed down your throat all seems more like an audition to work for DC and their low quality entertainment, rather than any serious attempt to grow the Guardian's franchise. Gunn could have, and should have shaved 60 minutes from this 2 hour grim mess. I've no interest in seeing any further Gunn projects, especially if he continues making animal snuff films under a Marvel banner. This isn't a family movie, it's for people who think torture can be entertaining. No thanks, Marvel.",0
"We all know the story: James Gunn was fired from Marvel over some old tweets, people whined, GotG cast threatened to force Marvel to let get them released from their contracts if Gunn didn't come back, etc., with some of them even saying that Gunn had planned the perfect end to the trilogy, so Gunn was brought back ... For what?

THIS??

GotG vol. 3 is NOT a good movie. It's unfocused, there's not really a story. Nebula who had an awesome arc in Infinity War and Endgame didn't do much here but scream and yell at people.

We were promised spectacle and heartbreak. It delivered on none of that.

Star-Lord will be back, they say. I hope to heck Gunn is gone for good.",0
"After 20 minutes I turned to my sons with a quizzical look and whispered ""this is really bad"" They agreed.

Guardians was always the MCU go to for clever humour, good plot, interesting characters and a blistering soundtrack. Vol 3 fails on all levels. Apart from a couple of amusing quips the humour is stale. The script was clunky, the chemistry between characters a little lost and the music was just bland.

While I thought the Rocket back story was sweet, I wonder if PETA were a collaborator on this movie.

It just felt like another franchise being totally Disneyfied and targeted at toddlers and the easily offended.",0
"Y'all must have watched a different movie than me. This is the worst Marvel in the last ten years in my opinion. Little to no plot/story, dumb villains, bad costumes, cheesy lines, unholy amount of plotholes, pure CGI feast... The only good thing in that movie was the cinematography, that's it. I questioned my status as a GotG fan and asked myself several times why I have to go through this ""movie"". Come on. Nothing made even slightly sense and the characters get weirder and worse. It just felt like a Disney movie the whole time but like a Disney movie where Walt Disney smoked crack and got blackout drunk before he wrote the script. It was even worse than Multiverse of Madness and Thor Love & Thunder and I thought thats's impossible. Just imagine the bad plot and nonsense from MoM combined withe cornyness and cringe of Love & Thunder and voil that's GotG 3. It doesn't have the charm of the old GotG movies and the music was not that important anymore. Total waste of money and time.",0
"The way that this film handles Rocket's character is very touching and mostly well done. However, aside from that and a handful of other character moments, this film is a string of contrivances and conveniences.

One of the largest plot problems is the sidelining of Mantis' powers. There are quite a few roadblocks in this film that the Guardians have to scramble to overcome, which could have been entirely avoided had Mantis used her powers.

Much of the antagonists' failures are due to their own lack of foresight or lack of muscle, despite both enemy factions having essentially limitless recourses and competence at their disposal.

The plot is strung along via convenience and contrivance, where the Guardians either luck out entirely or the situations are simply shoehorned together.

Gamorrah's behavior and introduction into the film feel especially contrived considering what we know of her characterization from pre-2014 Guardians and rolling into that film, where she was arguably the most altruistic of the group.

The humor works in some places, but it suffers from an extreme over-reliance on ""Drax dumb"" based jokes, which were already wearing thin by Infinity War.

Perhaps the most frustrating part of this film was the use of humor to interrupt serious moments of peril or drama. The first two films balanced humor with drama much better. Due to the driving motive for the Guardians being so desperate and personal in this outing, the humor more often than not feels wholly out of place.

There are numerous other issues characterization and world building.

On a subjective level, the camera work was often distracting. There is a large amount of close up shots, sometimes coming in before any establishing shots, which makes much of the first act feel claustrophobic in a bad way. There is also what feels like random use of slow motion at times. There was also a lot of spinning. A distracting amount of spinning.

The sense of space generally felt off due to editing and shot compositions, as well as a large reliance on large scope computer generated rooms or environments enveloping the characters. This was a shock since Gunn's other works tend to be very cohesive and pleasant to watch.

The score was forgettable, not sure I remember any of it, aside from the one time the Guardians' theme was used.

Aside from some poignant exceptions, the soundtrack felt more obligatory than like the film needed ALL of the twenty something songs which play at every other scene. A far cry from their careful use in the first film.

The performances were all stellar, especially the villain and Rocket.

This film had a great core story to tell, but it got bungled. I am very saddened by this, as the Guardians had been mostly sublime to this point.

Third best Marvel project since Infinity War, just behind the Spider-Man films.

Sad.",0
Nobody wants to see animal cruelty on screen. Marvel missed the idea completely and is officially ideologically and morally bankrupt. The story is fantastic but the writing and editing are lacking. They try to tear you out of horribly traumatic moments with levity and laughs. It is emotionally manipulative and all over the place. I encourage everyone to think for more than two seconds about you just watched. Think about the torture you had to endure with the characters and reclaim the narrative of emotions marvel tries to get you to feel. There are so many things that Marvel could have done to make it better. Don't be blinded by quick editing and instead understand that they are just capitalizing on your emotions.,0
"I'm seeing mostly glowing reviews and I think I may have seen a different movie. This was a loud, annoying, confused movie. It couldn't get out of it's own way. Somehow dark and cutesy at the same time. Adam Warlock was unnecessary to the story and poorly written. Many of the main characters are at death's door on many occasions with no consequences. Multiple fight scenes involving every character so you can't tell what's happening. Drax and Mantis' banter is mostly just obnoxious. They're like kids you just want to smack the whole time. Nebula just yells at everybody for 2 and a half hours. The High Evelutionary is way too over the top to the point where he's mostly just distracting. There were audible groans in the theater when Kraglin sees Yondu during the big battle.

There were positives, too. The flashbacks of Rocket were well done and moving. The FX were mostly great. Some of the songs were great songs and fit well in the movie. Some of the banter was funny. There was just way too much.",0
"It had some great moments. It started very strong and got me excited for the rest of the movie. Unfortunately I was let down. The positives of this movie kept me from going to the bathroom for the duration of its 2:30 run time. Rockets backstory was heartfelt and emotional. I really grew to love his character even more than I did. I didn't care much for Rocket before Endgame, but that movie helped to solidify his place in my heart as one of my favorites, and this movie only furthered that love for the character and I truly hope to see more of him. There was an amazing fight scene with interesting camera angles, cgi that didn't look like cgi on the big screen, and it made me go ""oooooh"" and laugh out loud a couple of times. Other than that this movie sucked. When it comes to group movies I always compare it to Ghostbusters. I know that's a high bar to hit but hear me out. Take into account the remake. Every character tried to be Bill Murray but failed horribly, and that's the problem with Marvel movies now. Every main character has to be the comic relief. They all have to have the same type of humor. Every single main character was trying to be funny and came off as dumb. They all got slimed and the theater was silent. Sure it is the best marvel movie of the year but that bar has dropped severely low recently. The last decent marvel movie was Black Panther 2. I wasn't a fan of the first one but I loved the 2nd and am very sad I missed it in theaters. I put it up against Endgame for quality. I dont expect Endgame quality everytime but atleast do all the hard work and years of build up justice. As a finale to the Guardians franchise, this was a disappointment. As a marvel movie, it hit the bar that's been set by the majority of the movies in the last few phases. If you can wait, watch it on Disney plus I mean you already pay for it.",0
"When it came out in 2014, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" far exceeded most people's expectations. Don't get me wrong, it's not an earth-shattering masterpiece by any means, but its clever humor, endearing camaraderie between its quirky heroes, entertaining use of 80s music, and uniqueness compared to other Marvel films made it a breath of fresh air that many people really enjoyed. The second film was not as good as the first, but still enjoyable enough. Unfortunately, the third film is very disjointed and lacks any semblance of a compelling overarching story to really work. While devoted Marvel fans will probably enjoy it more than I did, I view the film as overall further evidence of the MCU's decline in quality since the Infinity Saga.

In this film, the Guardians have to embark on a mission to protect (an injured) Rocket Raccoon from an evil villain, the High Evolutionary. The film alternates between garden-variety CGI/action setpieces and some surprisingly dark flashbacks to Rocket Raccoon's earlier life. Some viewers will be surprised by these flashbacks and find them to be more disturbing than they would expect from a ""Guardians"" movie. I do not think these scenes push the boundaries of the PG-13 rating (""The Batman,"" for example, contains scenes far more disturbing and graphic,) but parents bringing younger children starting to watch Marvel movies should note that their children could find them upsetting. The juxtaposition between the lighter humor and fun of the Guardians and these more tragic, trauma-based moments does not exactly work very well, since the plot is not compelling enough overall to justify the continued plot progression on both ends. The film's overall story is very generic and forgettable, and significant portions of the film feel surprisingly rather pointless in contributing to the such story. These concerns are intensified by the fact that the third act is pretty weak, and the first two acts don't really build up to it much.

The writing and humor are much weaker than the previous two ""Guardians"" films, especially the first one. The comedy here feels surprisingly forced and lazy, rather than genuine and clever. Additionally, at two and a half hours (longer than both of the first two films,) the film's runtime really does overstay its welcome, especially given the relative lack of a consistently compelling plot--or even significant attempts at plot structure. The film still has some mildly entertaining set pieces and a great soundtrack, so it's not a total misfire by any means, but it's very disappointing compared to the previous two ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" films--especially considering how much less than the sum of its parts this film feels. 5.5/10

Note: I saw an advance screening of the film in IMAX. The picture and sound quality were very good on the IMAX screen, and the film seemed to use the IMAX-expanded aspect ratio for nearly all of its running time.",0
"I'm not quite sure how a franchise that has knocked it out of the park to date (with one exception) could've messed up the formula this badly.

Maybe I should've paid more attention to the writing on the wall after that one Christmas Special miss, but I just assumed that project was an easy paycheck and not a directional change.

GotG3 starts weirdly and is super choppy throughout. On paper, the High Evolutionary storyline should've worked, but they spend far too much time away from it. The way they shoehorned Adam Warlock into the movie was almost criminal for a character that important.

There's a lot more, but I don't want to accidentally do a spoiler review.

It wasn't bad. But the flaws are so hard to ignore that I left the theater disappointed. If you're being honest, you did to.",0
"I've been a long-time fan of James Gunn, I always found that Guardians of The Galaxy was one of the better Marvel series, but with each film, I find that the quality goes down and down. This third film is no exception. There are some really strong moments but ultimately this film is the least funny, out of the trilogy, fails at being effectively serious, and feels more like an in-between film rather than a conclusive end to a trilogy. We learn more about Rocket's backstory, things we already knew, and the characters are set up for future films/Shows. That's all you get from the film. It Sucks.",0
"This was pretty disappointing as I loved the first Guardians movie (and enjoyed the second one). It just felt like a bit of a mess, and the acting and dialogue was not as good as the earlier MCU films.

Overall it was enjoyable and the 150 minutes passed relatively quickly, but way too much CGI for me and every time I started getting into it, I found myself snapped out of it by a corny line.

One of the biggest issues with it is that the ""grown up"" Rocket was largely absent from the movie and instead the character appeared though a highly disturbing yet at the same time saccharine back story.

Even the soundtrack seemed all over the place. It includes a couple of real gems (from Faith No More and Beastie Boys in particular) but there didn't seem to be a any time period or genre which linked all the tunes together. Maybe that's the point, but it felt a bit like Quill had left his iPod on shuffle.",1
"Speeding up an action sequence until it is a blur doesn't make it more exciting. Louder isn't better and it doesn't add to the story or experience. The story isn't bad but it is held back with the modern Marvel Studios decisions to make every battle more 'epic' than the last. More people, faster spinning, louder noise and rinse and repeat with 10% more for each battle. Acting was alright, story was alright, soundtrack was solid enough, designs were good but sped up to blur and volume raised to pounding distracted rather than complemented. I wish I could have seen more of the details in the world but sped up to fast and it was all a blur.",1
"I loved the first GotG, and enjoyed Vol. 2 a lot. For me they were original, quirky, funny films with an awesome soundtrack, great action sequences and a real feel-good factor to them.

This third instalment attempts to carry some of those traits over, but it also wants to be a serious, emotional film as it works its way through Rocket's tortuous back story. These two opposing threads make for uncomfortable bedfellows, and it hits from the very start of the movie. Any anticipation I felt for the film dissipated rapidly in the first 10 very depressing minutes, and I struggled to regain much enthusiasm for it. Perhaps this was an inevitable consequence following the events of the last Avengers movie, but even so I didn't feel it was handled all that well.

This was despite a pretty engaging revenge plot and a compelling and superbly portrayed primary antagonist. Adam Warlock was a welcome if somewhat underexplored addition to the cast, and a wide variety of imaginative and frequently grizzly selection of supporting characters were generally a bonus.

In fact it was the Guardians themselves who disappointed. Rocket and Star-Lord were largely humourless throughout. The three female guardians, including - strangely - Mantis, melded into the same universally angry, shouty character. Only Drax seemed to me to add value, as he was both funny and had a nice bit of character development rolled into it.

All in all, though this wasn't a bad film, it wasn't the film I was hoping it would be.",1
"Good to get some serious back story regarding Rocket, but the rest of the film was rather weak.

Much of the comedy seemed forced and insincere, and an overall plot being too predictable and forgettable. It would have benefitted from some better editing, there were just too many scenes that seemed to go on for too long and with no real meaning.

Seeing the graphic detail of Rocket's earlier abuse and mistreatment may not go well with children expecting a more fun creature depicted in the earlier films. This mix of the more dark look into life did not blend well with the often excessive lightheartedness in other parts of the film.

The first film in the series, great fun; the second, all right; this, definitely a 'could do better' score.",1
"The first Guardians of the Galaxy really surprised me and I loved the movie (so much it was my top favourite Marvel until No Way Home), and the second wasn't as great but still enjoyed it. This one made me feel.... Really let down and wanting more.

I did enjoy the more serious tone in parts - especially how Quill felt more like an anti-hero and hardened from all his losses, Nebula and Rocket were very well written, and how it felt like genuine closure for many of the characters stories, but for me that was kind of it.

First it felt like the characters, specially Drax/Nebula/Mantis didn't like each other for most of the film (which was strange as the whole thing is set up to be protecting one of their own) and Adam Warlock was SUPER underwhelming - really felt more his whole point of existence was to save Quill in the end. And I get they wanted to make Drax more of a parent in this film, but I felt like Gamora in the sense they wanted the old Drax gone and made him knew to the point he's a whole new character. I'm also not sure how to feel about Gamora's plot; I liked her roughness but also felt she was too angsty and didn't like anyone; but also Quill felt a little similar to that in Guardians 1, so maybe to show how the ravagers affected them and their childhood traumas.

The humour was definitely different too, but was unsure how much of it was genuinely funny or not. Also the amount of fake out deaths (like seriously both Drax and Nebula should have died more than once but are miraculously healed scenes later) was really strange, cause James Gunn is a great writer where that isn't needed. The soundtrack was good for the most part, but where in between kidnapping Kevin Bacon and Tony Stark's funeral did Quill learn about ""Creep"" but more importantly ""The Dog Days are Over""? Do not get me wrong I adore both Radiohead and Florence Welsh but it felt like my own spotify shuffle going from 90's to 70's to 80's to 2000's....

I will say too - the multiple shots of animal abuse was definitely not needed. I get Rocket had a super traumatic upbringing, but seeing animals with robotic parts or destroyed in a chamber felt very excessive. IDK why we needed about 5 different flashbacks of it but I genuinely felt like I couldn't sit through the rest of the movie after the 2nd scene. I think it should be more discussed in reviews that happens as it can be triggering for young kids and even some adults.",1
"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.

First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.

And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.

Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.

The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.

My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.

So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.

In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",1
"I am disappointed. Although Guardians 3 is not a bad movie per se, it is definetly the worst of the three.

All the sillyness and light hearted jokes of the first two installments seemed just forced: The characters used to argue a lot in the previous movies too, but here the arguments seem more serious and sometimes the friendship actually looks damaged. Rocket gets the spotlight, but most of the background story is simply too dark. I wanted to watch the movie with my kids, but this is not a kids movie. The first two were kind of violent too, but not in this grim, dark and desperate way.

Nebula does not seem to fit in the crew, Drax does not do much at all, Groot seems strangely hallow and 'unfinished', only Starlord and Gomorra have a somewhat interesting tension. Both the adult groot and baby groot from 1 and 2 had something going on, young Groot here seems to lack any personality. The writers did not know how to use this character. The actors sometimes played as if it was the last day before summer vacation - just get it done and forget about it.

I always liked the family and friendship aspect of the first two, because it was somewhat ridiculed by the characters themselfs (""5 idiots standing in a circle"" from the first, or ""that unsaid thing"" between Gomorra and Starlord or Drax being gentle to Baby-Groot at the end of part 2), but here it's not embedded in the actions anymore. It has to be said, over and over again.

For a Grand Finale it often feels too complex, too empty and too forced. Was it a bad movie - no, probably not, but it was for sure not up there with the other two. I will probably re-watch it in a couple of years, hopefully I like it more then. (""Endgame"" also grew on me, so there is hope.)

It also sucks that there are so many fake ratings on IMDB, some even don't try to hide it.",1
"I wish I could un-see this movie. It was much darker than I have come to expect from MCU movies, especially with regards to animals. The film gives a traumatizing backstory for Rocket, which includes many, many scenes of terrified baby animals and horrific animal experimentation. I don't ever cry in movies, and I sobbed through this one... and not in a good way. The film also contains troubling shots of innocent people being hurt or killed (which is sometimes implied in other films, but not typically shown in such an awful, direct manner). None of the ""good parts"" are enough to redeem what I was forced to watch. I would definitely not recommend it for kids.",0
"I am sincerely surprised seeing all those good reviews . Honnestly it was bad. I didn't hear a single laugh for the whole movie, no ""wow"". It was dead silent. Saw couple of folks leaving.

The funniest character of the guardians was there all along, but he was almost dead except for the last 10 minutes. Not a single line, no action for Rocket. Except when they were digging in his past, when he wasn't really Rocket. And those parts were so cheesy i was pretty close to leave.

At least when Groot re-borned in the second movie it was funny seeing baby Groot. Here they left Rocket aside. It's like new guys wrote the script for this one cause it was completely different. It was a serious Guardian of the galaxy, no special bad-ass vibes we used to see.

10 the first, 8 for the second, and only 2 for this one.",0
"The miserable run from Marvel since EndGame has depressed our entire family. Dr Strange/Multiverse broke the camel's back. Surely, Guardians would be the shining light amidst the darkness. A brilliant cast with brilliant chemistry couldn't possibly go wrong. Wow. How wrong we were. The darkness, the unending anger across the board, even from the softer souls in 1&2. Child abduction, vivid animal cruelty, and two key characters omitted or morphed in such a way that the rest of the cast delivered banter with juddering effect. Heartbroken. Hopefully, like Star Wars, we will get a true, uplifting Finale2. The Guardians deserve it, and so do we.",0
"I loved the original: a pure gem of a film. While the second wasn't nearly as good, it is still rewatchable and that's not easy for a sequel. But this conclusion to the trilogy is bad on every level. How people who liked the previous films can gush over this one is simply beyond me. Lazy plotting. The soundtrack, while loaded with good songs, fails to deliver any emotional payoff. The humour consists of a few chuckles. Too many characters scream at each other. And the film just goes on and on. Gunn should have put the script through several revisions. Perhaps his mind was on the DC universe. It wasn't here.",0
"Marvel seems to be making contest for the ugliest world created in its movies. The world in the latest Ant Man looks like fungus under the microscope. While the world in this one is full of weird creatures that look like they were taken from this H. G. Wells book 'The Island of Dr Moreau'. The movie is weak. Definitely the weakest of all three Guardians of Galaxy movies. I guess it was supposed to be emotional. But it's not. It fails even there, because all these creatures are so grotesque. It still has good music though, but that's the only plus I can think of. Also, why is Gamora even there? She died god damn it. But sure, in sci - fi it's not a problem, let's just tell the viewers that the new Gamora is from the parallel universe. Of course I have nothing against Zoe Saldana. She's incredibly talented and so cute. But she shouldn't be there.

And of course this overblown 8,3 rating. No this, movie is not 8,3. It's not even 3. I don't know what is happening with Marvel but still not even one good movie since Avengers Infinity War / Endgame.",0
"Only those without a shred of feeling in their bodies are going to be able to enjoy Guardians of the Galaxy 3.

This film was brutal and dark. It needs trauma content warnings for people who cannot tolerate depictions of animal abuse even if cgi. To have been able to write such a narrative, let alone depict it the way they had, indicated a lack of empathy.

Spent portions of the film with my hands over my eyes rather than watching.

There were a few positive moments in the story but they were insufficient to redeem the film.

Not a saving grace but about as close to it as it comes is the soundtrack and the resolution of a couple of cross film story arcs.",0
"Just back from watching the new guardians movie in the cinema and quite frankly I'm shocked and disturbed at the amount of animal cruelty in this movie. It was disgusting. Thankfully my 11 year old opted to stay home for this cinema trip. It was just way too much, I'm really disappointed. What the hell Disney!?

More disturbing than some horror movies. Not suitable for kids at all.

The parts without animal abuse were ok, we laughed a few times but felt like crying more often than not.

Hopefully the true reviews shine through and Disney have a long hard look at themselves. It's a one time only watch for me unfortunately!",0
"First Guardians of the Galaxy was really the best of the 3. Second one wasn't so bad but this 3rd Guardians of the Galaxy is so bad, I wanted to leave just 10 minutes into the movie. The dialogues were so terrible, it bordered on lame and ""WTF!"" The story line was ok but still not enough for me to give this movie a higher rating.

Normally, I would tell people to wait for the movie to be shown on Disney+ or Netflix or wherever if I think the movie is not worth watching in theaters. In this case, I wouldn't recommend watching this movie in theaters or even on Disney+. It's just not worth it! Go watch some other movies.",0
"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.

At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.

The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",1
"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.

Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.

Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.

I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them. Oh and I forgot to mention it's pretty funny.",1
"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.

The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.

This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment. While the film has a few flaws, it's still a fun and engaging, with Rocket standing out as the heart and soul of the movie.",1
"You have to stand up to the work that James Gunn has done with the guardians, not very well-known characters and risking everything to a film that in my opinion ended up being the best saga that marvel has given us in this universe, like the previous ones, it achieves an emotional, entertaining, funny and epic film with a worthy end to this trilogy. The movie is accompanied by some decent special effects, a good soundtrack, and an excellent selection of music that feels great when you're listening to it, I instantly connected with the movie minus the villain. A good Marvel movie was needed after such bad projects that had been released.",1
"Marvel cinematic universe has produced more than 30 movies and new projects may not please your eye anymore. In spite of being a part of this universe, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" have always stood apart from the rest of superhero movies. It's because of the heartwarming atmosphere, amazing soundtrack, humor, ironic attitude of the characters and exciting space battles.

It is all the more surprising that the final part of the trilogy, directed by James Gann, turned out to be darker and more dramatic than expected. The film raised essential questions about the place of individuals in a huge evil world, the absurdity of the idea of an ideal society, and the importance of the life of every species as well. Even though the creators used obviously manipulative techniques to play on the emotions of the viewer, I would say that storyline of Rocket the Raccoon is the main advantage of the film and it really touches you. And I can't help saying that story wouldn't be so emotional and terrifying without an amazing voice acting cast.

However, the main theme of the third volume is definitely friendship. Star Lord is no longer the main character and Gann has focused on developing all the team characters.

The main cast, Dave Batista (Drax), Pom Klementieff (Mantis), and Karen Gillan (Nebula), got more screen time, and they performed brilliantly and look very harmonious. Above all, Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. The High Evolutionary, creating a new world inhabited by a perfect race, makes you hate him. Although he is absolutely disgusting because of his actions, he is still attractive at the same time. I could add him to the collection of the most unpleasant villains from the comics.

'Guardians' cause empathy and they sincerely please you with their appearance on the screen. The visual effects team did an amazing job bringing to life the fantastical universe. And what's more, the view of bio-structural planet was breathtaking and I felt like a child looking at the pictures in an anatomy book for the first time. The film ends very poetically with the song that opened the first film.

In my opinion, this is a very worthy conclusion to the story, the best film of the trilogy, and one of the best films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",1
"The ending to the guardians of the galaxy movies didn't miss action, comedy or romance. The way it played with the soundtrack was on another level. You'll notice it's filming techniques are up to date and the cgi had nothing to complain about, no goofy ahh MODOC cgi (quantumania) or scenes that looked like they were filmed on a blank green screen, it truely was a work of cinema and lacked nothing in this way. Although it was your typical villain from the past coming back for revenge, this story was probably the saddest marvel project to date and hit harder than I was expecting.

Watch this in the biggest screen you can, completely worth it.",1
"I was really hyped to watch this movie but also very sceptical. I was a follower of Marvel for quite a while but I fell out of love with Marvel for a while simply becuase the movies felt repetitive and basically just fodder for the universe. Enter Guardians of the Glaxay 3.

This movie was simply put just very fun to watch. The action is really good, the story is solid, the characters are still enjoyable (sometimes they drift a bit to the annoiyng side but they manage to balance it well enough so that you do not dislike anyone), the music is great, the villian is enjoyable and the ending is a nice ending of the triology.

If you have not watched it, then watch it. It is some damn good stuff.",1
"Why do I love guardians of the galaxy?

Because it makes me laugh and is very creative. This movie barely made me laugh and the crew was literally screaming at each other the entire time. The witty banter and teasing that was commonplace in the prior films has transformed into a hideous dialogue devoid of any soul. And this movie was insanely dark and gruesome beyond imagining. It just seems like every new movie has to be more screwed up, more EXTREME, more VIOLENT, more DRAMATIC instead of being creative in a new way. I went to this movie in hopes of some laughs and fun after a rough day. Instead this movie was like a star collapsed into a blackhole sucking itself inward with such a tremendous force that light can no longer escape. What an unfortunate trajectory hollywood has taken these days.",0
"What a dreadful dogs dinner of a movie this was - an hour too long, too much mawkish sentimentality, too many scenes where a character had to explain what was going to happen next, too much miraculous recovery from serious injury, etc. Then towards the end, when we'd been bombarded with an overdose of explosions and killing, pretty much all the characters started shouting at each other.

And why so many scenes that seemed to be written for five years olds followed by so many freakish almost nightmarish animal mutations? The film just became ever more ridiculous and stupid to the point where it was just plain irritating.

If this is the last one in the Guardian series then it's definitely one too many.",0
"As a big fun of Guardian franchise, I have to say this one is boring, annoying, and unnecessarily childish. I just wish to get out the theater halfway through the movie. Maybe the animal protection theme is the reason why it is rated so high. The movie can be easily made into a 90 minutes version. The constant shouting and anger serve no purpose but to annoy audiences. The comedy is at least two grades down from the previous series. To be fair, I think this one should be rated about the same as the latest Thor movie at around 6.5. But since so many people give such absurd high rating, I feel the need to balance it.",0
"I loved the first film. The second was not quite as good but enjoyable nonetheless. So I was looking forward to a lighthearted, action packed, humorous adventure with a great soundtrack. I was disappointed on all accounts.

The first hour of unnecessary gratuitous animal cruelty left me feeling physically sick. The story picked up in the second half. But this was no lighthearted feel good movie. It tugged on the emotions in a way that was extremely manipulative. Caged children. Vivisection. Mass genocide. This is a dark, dark movie.

Where were the classic hits? Where was the humour? Where was the feel good factor?

I regret watching it.",0
"The darkness in this movie is very clear. Animal cruelty, children in cages, and of course the line; ""there is no god"", from the main animal abuser. DO NOT bring your children to this movie. The message is very violent and diluted. The original characters (and unique guardians of the galaxy vibe) are lost in poor writing, the storyline was all over the place, and there was so much anger in the undertone of the ""family"" dynamic. The graphic violence towards animals was too much for kids; this is the stuff that subconsciously programs people with more fear and anger. We were left with a deep feeling of disgust after viewing. Please don't give them your money... we do not need this type of content in the world.",0
"I fear what the future of DC movies will be. If James Gunn does this to DC, then don't bother seeing any of the upcoming films. Too much CGI, too much goofiness, bad story. Rocket was the best part of the movie. I felt as if my time was stolen from me and I was misled by everyone who said this was a good movie. I don't understand why it's so hard to make a good film in this genre. So many of these titles have a long history of excellent stories but Hollywood types take them and try to put their own spin on them and ruin them. A good film requires more than a good sound track. If this is the future of the genre then it is on its way out.",0
"They say, if you've seen one Marvel movie, then you've seen them all.

Guardians Vol 3 adds absolutely nothing new to the superhero genre, it's dull and quite predictable from start to finish, albeit I walked out possibly 30 minutes before it ended.

The plot centers around Rocket, his origins and past. I found the whole story very dull for an adult, perhaps, kids between the ages of 4 and 8 could find it amusing. His past involving brotherly love to other animals being experimented on by an evil warlord was forced and dull.

So much melodrama added, they tried making us emotionally connected to the animals, which I didn't feel, i thought they were childish cartoon characters with no background or developed characters. The scene were they chose their names was supposed to be the high point where we identify with them and connect, for me, zero connection.

They then added a somewhat violent scene that enraged Rocket, probably for kids, its frightening, for adults was over dramatic.

The whole animal unite theme seemed forced.

Seemed like a movie called Cats and Dogs or G force.

They also tried to build other characters that i felt absolutely no connection with, namely the mohawk telepathy guy and the talking dog.

Some humorous scenes were actually funny but only a few. Special effects no longer matter after the hundreds of movies out there using CGI. Action was lame and because of the lack of stakes, there is no tension invested in the scene.

The villain is possibly the worst i've ever seen, one dimensional angry lord who doesn't like to be questioned, formulatic and copy paste from Disney villains.

For the first time ever, I walked out of a Marvel movie before it ended, i just couldn't tolerate the cringing script and dialogue, the excessive melodrama, the childish scenes and how predictable it was.

And yeah, they had to find a group of lost kids who were so annoying but required saving and hurray !!! We are all happy ,,add to that the long run time and i just couldn't sit through it all.

For some reasons, the writers and directors thought cute animals and kids will automatically trigger emotions in viewers, which i did not feel whatsoever.

Do yourselves a favor and skip this.",0
"The Guardians of the Galaxy franchise has always been a thrilling ride, filled with quirky humor, lovable characters, and stunning visuals. Unfortunately, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" stumbles and falls short of its predecessors, delivering a muddled and poorly executed script that may only appeal to the youngest of viewers. Ultimately, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a disappointing misfire, offering little more than surface-level enjoyment for kids who aren't as invested in the narrative. It's a far cry from the previous installments, which managed to strike a balance between lighthearted fun and compelling storytelling.",0
"This is a decent show, good performances all round. It is compelling viewing with a smart script.

However it is nowhere near as good as people claim. It is repetitive, not much changes over 4 seasons, mostly going in circles and coming back to the same themes. The main cast are all utterly hateful with no redeeming features meaning you don't particularly care about any of them. Some (Roman) you actively dislike, this may be indicative of a good performance but it means you actively root against him. If this is an accurate depiction of the lives of the super rich then it is a depressing outlook.

Some talk about the script but the swearing, whilst creative, doesn't hold a candle to The Thick of it.

For me the 4th season (and ending) has been massively overated. The compressed timeframe is an interesting idea but leads to episodes being quite dull in my opinion.",0
"It's not TV, it's HBO.

HBO has done it again. Succession is one of the most well written and well acted shows ever. Jesse Armstrong and Mark Mylod as the writer-director pair have created an unparalleled work of family drama/comedy. It unfolds as a great work of Greek tragedy.

The cast ensemble does a terrific job of bringing the characters to the screen. All these awful people portrayed so well by these bunch of actors. Kendall is the tragic antihero you root for. Roman is the fu*ked up boy who conceals his insecurities by making offensive jokes all the time. Then there is Siobhan, Connor, Logan, Tom, Gerri, Greg and so many more great characters; each having their distinct characteristics. Such well fleshed out characters!

This is the best show on television in the last decade or so. And worthy of being considered among the greatest shows of all time.",1
"My first impression about this show was that it's ok, or at least not a waste of time. I found it astonishing that a story filled with metaphors and delicately designed character dynamics alone provided me enough dopamine to watch the first two seasons. Succession did it all through a well-choreographed series of interactions and dialogues, not some intense visual effects, action scenes, criminal figures, or goofy comedy.

The last season turns a good show into a masterpiece. All episodes are jaw-dropping, and the breathtaking suspension didn't leave me until the last second. To fully understand and vibe with some episodes in the third season, it's worth watching the entire show.",1
"This show is an embarrassment to those who actually work in the Fortune 100 space. The dialogue and writing is SO 2006, that it presents as more a parody of multi-billion dollar companies, rather than a suspense-filled, realistic, representation of how the corporate world actually works. It is SO dumbed-down, yet tries to seem ""relevant"". The poor writing and research showcases the feeble attempt to enchant watchers who wish to better-understand big business. It is 100% not accurate and very, very bad. The only good bits are Roman's character and the episode where the situation was a ""closed circuit."" End the series or create a spin-off based on Roman's character, because his is the ONLY one that is even close to real life. Also, the theme song is amazing - so, at least, keep that.",0
"A year or three back, I glimpsed the three-helicopter scene in episode 1 and thought, 'I don't want to watch a Dynasty for the 2020's'. First impressions were slightly off.

Later, I learnt that Jesse Armstrong was the creator. Oh, right - 'Peep Show', 'The Thick Of It'. English comedies that take the comedy of embarrassment (pioneered in Spinal Tap) a stage further than Ricky Gervais' 'The Office'. In 'Succession', Armstrong takes on the USA, as in 'The (US) Office'. The British script invasion of the 2020s: now THERE would be a satire.

Armed with this knowledge I thought episode 1 was quite funny, the depiction of a disgustingly rapacious, self-obsessed family whose wealth made it even more dysfunctional than if it had not been. Brian Cox does ALL the heavy lifting into the realm of satire. Episode 2 with Brian unconscious, however, was inexorably monotonous, ie 'who will be the successor while the patriarch is in hospital?', as if anyone would care. Episode 3 ground to an unamusing, tedious halt. Rinse and repeat, repeat, repeat.

Some demented professional reviewers are comparing Succession to Tolstoy, etc (must be the work involved in ploughing through it). Obviously they's not actually read much Tolstoy, and hope you haven't, either. Believe me, this is not Tolstoy . Maybe not even Ricky Gervais.",0
"Not going to say too much , inorder to keep things fresh for you. The show is fantastic , but you should give it time. 5 episodes in and you will love it. Don't worry about it's conclusion. It just came and I can say it is perfection. Look for Tom ,Gregg and Shiv and wait for Kandall! They will shine !

The acting and music is so good. Writing is another level ( Breaking Bad and Sopranos Level of Writing ). The way they told the story and all the hints from the begining is so fantastic. I am going to rewatch the whole thing , now that I watched the finale. I can't recommend this show enough. Just start it!",1
"I loved the characters it felt real , they felt like a family I loved the journey I was routing for a particular character as if it was reality . It's over and I'm devastated that I won't be able to look forward to succession on Monday nights anymore . Best tv series of my life . Thank you.

Most tv shows do not get better with each series but this does . Credit to the writer and the actors and actresses . It felt like everyone had a game plan and they all played their hands well . Hbo only do box office tv and this is certainly the best . Season 4 didn't have a single slow episode . Teamkendall.",1
"It was just ridiculous. Really? That end?

The sweetest character of the show, Greg, ending up like that?

Tom, the most annoying and st**** character,""ending up like that?

That final fight between the siblings... Just forced dialogues, forced fights.

Didnt make any sense this finale after 1 hour of episode.

I watched dozens of tv shows in my life but I'm watching less and less with the time.

You need to watch 5 series finales to catch one good Hours and hours of your life throwed at the garbage.

I think I'm just gonna stick with movies. At least if its bad, you just lost 2 hours of your life.",0
"It didn't end the way I wanted, but it was still a great finale, I would have liked kendall to take over the company, kendall was the losing team at the end of the day, I think he didn't deserve it, shiv caused the company to leave the hands of the family just out of jealousy, that's my opinion. At the end of the day, Tom was the most profitable, his marriage is getting better, he's going to have a child, and he took over the company. Greg is still Tom's dirty work guy. Thank you to Hbo for this amazing series, they did the right thing by not prolonging the end, they finished in the best place.",1
"""Succession"" is an excellent series that reminds us that everyone wants love, even billionaires. It has a flawless screenplay that pushes us to the edge of compassion but doesn't make us fall in love with the unscrupulous yet human characters.

The actors and actresses deliver a refined performance, deserving of all the awards they received throughout the four seasons. The settings are flawless, and the cinematography is impeccable. The pace is flexible, occasionally losing its way in one or two episodes, but it doesn't fail in the screenplay, which is completely aligned and coherent. The final season is among the top five best I've ever seen.",1
"What an amazing show; everything came together with this one. The writing is incredible and combined with top class actors - some great new finds on Strong and Snook - this show has become one for the classics.

If a tv show can make you feel sick to your stomach but is impossible to look away from, something that at times feels like a real life train wreck happening in front of your eyes, it belongs at the top. At least for me it does.

HBO you've done it again. After The Wire, Sopranos and Game of Thrones this is another one for the books. So so incredibly sad this show had ended. But they did it so well take I can just be grateful for this gift of a show. Thanks!",1
"Is it an entertaining show? For sure. But there is something about the series that felt like it was never going anywhere and the characters never really achieve anything. Ultimately that was correct, the ending didn't resolve anything meaningful. Shiv changing her mind in the boardroom like some kind of teenage melodramatic fit just didn't work. The dialog while funny and well written was often so over the top it went into fantasy land so far it become incredibly unrealistic.

There wasn't enough character development really throughout the 4 series and the same themes weee playing in series 1 as series 4 with them all just trying to get ahead but none of them actually did.",1
"In the entertainment industry. Mostly lack of originality with a sprinkle of creativity. But that's our entertainment industry now. Mediocrity is the norm.

Additionally, today's Hollywood moguls insist upon giving us a force-fed diet of CGI infused, ridiculously unbelievable, diet of botulistic pablum that only a population-cohort raised on video games would pay even 25 cents to watch. Oh yeah I forgot, its $25.

As always, we should vote with our wallets, but the masses and decision makers don't. The consumers, are partly to blame. We keep buying tickets, merchandise and streaming subscriptions, even if we complain about them. We keep feeding the beast that devours our imagination and creativity.

This my friends is why humanity has never been this dysfunctional since we burned women at the stake.",0
"The camera style is nonstop shaky and in and out zooming. I love the show, but I almost quit watching because of the nonstop up and down of the camera and the unnecessary zooming in. This season must've been shot by a beginner. If not, the director thought it would be nice to pay homage to The Office, by capturing this season in a documentary style. It's awful. HBO has a reputation of high quality film, but this season is rough. I can't even focus on the dialogue because the camera shakes and pans in and out the entire time. What the f happened to this show? Nepotism? Did they let a family member replace an experienced cameraman?",0
"Succession may very well be one of the greatest tv shows of all time!

It's a premise that tells the story of power and dynasty, a story that's been told time and time again since the beginning of time and the beginning of Shakespeare. Yet, Succession takes that idea and puts it into a modern day narrative, subjectively changing the story and shedding a completely new light on the classic tale.

It's dark, evil and witty but it also has its moments of warmth and harmony.

Ultimately Succession is a tragedy, as the writers have stated, and it was always intended to be a tragedy. Sad and gloomy but carrying enough essence to tell such a raw and complex tale in a format that is somewhat controversial. The classic shaky camera gimmick mix with the most realistic and dramatic script you'll ever hear, gives a sense of pride and purpose. And left with all these unanswered thoughts and questions. And when It's all over it really leaves you with a wondering ""what do I do now?""

But at the end of the day Succession started as a simplistic slice of life story, and ended all the same. Because life is unpredictable and doesn't always end the way you planned it.

If you haven't garnered up the urge to watch Succession, I highly recommend you try. Yes, it can be a little bit slow durning the first 2 seasons, but you really learn to love all the characters because of it. And once you become fully invested in the show, it will easily become one of the best forms of entertainment you can have, and there's no going back after that.

Succession is the only tv show I will ever give a 10/10 rating too",1
"This show isn't particularly funny nor entertaining so how is it a comedy ? Most characters are despicable, obnoxious and the plot is all but realistic so not a drama either. I can not remember the number of times I wanted to stop watching and only kept going because the reviews were so good especially for the last season.... If it wasn't for a few episodes with a decent pace that provided a mildly interesting twist and the presence on screen of Brian Cox... Seriously though the main characters have nowhere near the required depth to be worth that much screen time and the whole storyline revolves around a handful of deals or votes, that's it. Also for an HBO show it is incredibly lazy: lazy script, lazy costumes, lazy sets, lazy soundtrack (an excellent main theme that is used throughout the whole serie and nothing else ?). I give it a 6 because it would not make sense to go below for this level of production but sill, I am utterly baffled by the number of 10s and awards Succession is racking up for, in my opinion, not a single good reason.",1
"My wife and I were both obsessed with this show, tuning in every week since the beginning and loving every bit of it. It's hilarious at points, extremely tense in others and the acting is top notch. We had extremely high expectations for the finale due to the high bar set throughout the show but in our opinions, they failed to deliver and it made us sad.

Succession is some of the best TV we've seen since Game of Thrones and it suffered the same fate with the ending. The acting was great but the way things unfolded seemed, ""let's subvert expectations and provoke emotion, regardless if it makes the least sense"" rather than ""let's do this because it aligns with the characters personality and makes sense"". Characters were making crazy out-of-character decisions and when asked why, responded with something akin to, ""just because I said so"". Everything felt kind of ""off"" and nothing was clicking the way it clicked in almost every episode beforehand. It felt like the show was this incredible 4 year bike race and right before they get to the finish line, one person takes a hard right and cycles to the pub for a pint - everyone ends up disqualified, the event is cancelled, everyone who invested everything into competing and those who spent all their time watching for a conclusion are given the reason ""just because"".

Could probably think of a better analogy but I didn't ""just because"".

PS Greg's character had the best development and stayed true to himself until the end. Well done Greg! We love you!",1
"The title I cribbed from an NYT comment, I had been a fan throughout of this often excellently written quasi-drama/actually-a- comedy led by the guy who did Peep Show, but the fourth season became a chore to finish: the intrigues were getting stale, there's only so much juice you can squeeze out of this and it was high time they ended it. You really can't knock the writing, it's prestige TV, but I am also truly skeptical this show will have any staying power or wider cultural resonance.

In terms of the cast Jeremy Strong and Matthew Macfayden were the standouts for me, Braun a good (albeit one-note) comedy insert, Culkin was the least interesting child and also more like a one-note comedy character, I don't think Cox was doing anything memorable, and Snook I disliked the most, difficult to pin it either on the character or how she played it; Ruck's character was also hilarious as were a lot of the peripheral characters.",1
"I liked the first season because it was telling a clever joke and I proudly ""got it"": rich people cannot personify their wealth/fame/etc. The kids want to be Daddy, Daddy wants the kids to really be him (instead of faking it) so they can inherit the kingdom. Both of those things are impossible because ""Daddy"" is a fantasy. They all hate each other because they're trying to live out the same impossible fantasy, except this particular fantasy demands that they also ruin each other's roleplay. Everyone incl Brian Cox believes they're running an actual empire and plays out their roles as pretenders fighting for the throne, with life and death stakes. But it's just a media corp, an entertainment/propaganda/culture factory same as any other, operationally integrated with the state and not even trying to hide it (see Alan MacLeod). And Brian Cox is just an old rich a-hole whose hell is watching his insufferable failchildren's antics in silent, bemused despair as he hobbles out of life.

It began as a decent satire of modern life in general, not rich people specifically. The ""decadent lifestyles of the rich and famous"" aspect of it was supposed to be the hook, as well as the setup for playing the suffering of these characters for laughs. And it was funny. What is a joke after all? Something absurd and out-of-place irrupting into the mundane social world, throwing it into sharp relief, showing us how stupid and pointless it is. The rich kids will stay rich no matter who ends up running the company. But they want to be the one... really effing badly. They want to be Daddy. Because it's something to do, something that seems less pointless and futile than regular life. It might turn out to be a fantasy, the essence of which is even more pathetic than real life. So what? We'll play.

It should go without saying that all of this is far more applicable to middle-class people - the kind who watch Succession - than the offspring of our reptilian overlords, who have the means to both feel like and be regarded as genuinely decent people who are trying to help. Unfortunately the show forgets that from season 2 onwards, becoming a parody of itself.

From that point on it turned into an epic drama coldly calculated to pander to the demographic that vicariously enjoys portrayals of wealth but have seen too much Jon Stewart not to also simultaneously feel that oh-so-familiar WASP cocktail of guilt and moral vanity. A highbrow soap opera. The weird stunted delivery of fake corporate jargon and florid cussing is now supposed to reflect the characters' insecurities and self-esteem issues, as opposed to the overproduction of communication (see Baudrillard, 'The Ecstasy of Communication). These rich people with their town cars, amply hedged portfolios and outrageously expensive rehabs *are just like us.* The show portrays them harshly but fairly, and mediates those immense gaps of net worth with its sensitive, therapeutic study of the human *blah blahdee blah blerrrgh*. Instead of being the medium for lampooning the soul-crushing banality of life in terminally dysfunctional capitalist civilization, the ""realistic"" billionaire failson lifestyle reflects the most pleasant version of it back to us, making us feel valid and seen.",0
"Succession is a funny series, but narratively it offers nothing. There is no character development (all characters stay the same throughout the story); there are no dramatic arcs (every chapter revolves around the same power plays) and the story ends exactly where it begins. It's a funny show, but extremely repetitive and generic. Also, after a while you realize that all the characters appeal to the same humor. At times the show is nothing more than quirky people talking stupid nonsense and nothing more. Quite disappointed in general with how this series develops, especially its conclusion, which is beyond lousy and lame. There is no rewatchabilty once you know the ending.",0
"By far, the biggest waste of time. This show didn't do anything for me. It's been boring, the storyline is very mediocre. It's very repetitive, Kendall, Shiv, Roman and Logan keep teaming up in different ways and screwing each other. Nothing really happens to most storylines that they make and they move onto the next. People like this show because of the power shown, money, and all the cuss words and dirty language used on the show. To me, it just makes them seem immature, including Logan, and powerless in a way. It brings nothing to television, nothing even entertaining to watch. I used to at least enjoy Greg and how funny he was but he wasn't even funny in the final season.

Nothing really happens. Four seasons of just conversation and fights about who's going to take over? Very disappointing show, disappointing ending, I wasn't at all shocked or surprised. Don't waste your time.",0
"On the outside this looks like a corporate show but it's not, it's about the lives of those who control a corporate empire. It deals with drug addiction and murder and guilt and greed and basically everything in-between. Every single line in the show is great, everything Roman shows is a non stop laugh and this is the funniest show ever made, a comedy wrapped up in a drama done to perfection, don't judge it off of the first few episodes as it had a bit of a rough start but it's an absolute treasure to watch every minute from the start of episode 6. The show just finished but it will stick with us forever.",1
"The show followed its cliche until the end. Since the start of the first season, Kendal tried to take over and he lost at the end. I could see the reason for this, the man was a murderer but the ending doesn't make sense to me yet. Obviously, Tom is not going to save his seat and as soon as the state of the company gets stable, Lukas will get rid of him too, or in the best situation he will be just a puppet. Shiv showed she was desperate for love despite Tom having no feelings for her, and it was such a horrible end for her character. The only thing I liked was Roman, he understood the situation before and after the meeting.",0
"Many TV shows that other people love just haven't been doing it for me lately. I don't know why, but I think a bunch are really overrated and kind of pale in comparison to the ""golden age"" shows of the 2000s and maybe the early 2010s (truth be told, I think the golden age of TV ended about a decade ago). But I may just be old-fashioned and/or nostalgic.

So I approached Succession with some hesitancy. I don't want to say what recent critically acclaimed shows haven't worked for me, but it's been a bunch. And I was always afraid Succession would join those ranks. Thankfully, it didn't. This show lives up to the hype.

I began watching it in early 2023, so I could catch up and watch the final season week by week. With seasons 1-3, I more or less knew what to expect, thanks to memes, online discourse, and hearing friends talk about the show. But watching it week to week was a whole other thing altogether, and given how surprising the final season gets, I hope new viewers who discover this show in the coming years can go into it knowing relatively little.

As for the earlier seasons, I never understood why people think it started slow. I was hooked from the start, though I always approached this as more of a comedy than a drama. I really think that still holds true. This show's characters are just too awful to get too invested in, though occasionally, Succession does make me feel sorry for a couple of them here and there. Rather than unlikable characters being a flaw, I think it feels by design. In many ways, it makes the show funnier.

Season 3 might've been the only season that sagged a little for me; it felt just a bit samey and awkward to a very minor extent, and only in some episodes (and only compared to seasons 1, 2, and 4, too). Otherwise, the show's overall close to perfect. It's been a blast to watch, the writing and acting have been phenomenal, and I reckon I'll watch the whole thing again, from start to finish, within the next few years. I find it's overall easy to recommend to pretty much anyone.",1
"Shiv held all the power at the shareholders' meeting, and she is savvy enough to know that. All she had to do was threaten Kendall and Roman that she would vote against the family unless they agreed in writing that she would run the company. Then they could have had a role at some level in Waystar, instead of being adrift with little opportunity of ever being employed elsewhere. And any startups they might have planned if they were no longer at Waystar would inevitably have gone under. Shiv was right about Kendall's inadequacies and Tom was only a puppet for Matsson. Shiv never would have ended up with Tom in the limousine at the end of the show as she never respected him.",0
"The series finale episode was an absolute disaster, leaving viewers in a state of utter disappointment and frustration. It was a perfect example of how not to wrap up a beloved show. The writers seemed determined to inflict maximum emotional torture on the audience, with no regard for their investment and loyalty throughout the series.

The episode lacked any semblance of coherence or logic, throwing away years of character development and narrative arcs. It felt as though the writers were intentionally trying to sabotage their own creation.

The writers not only failed to give the character of Shiv a satisfying arc, but they actively made her detestable, ensuring that viewers would despise her for the rest of their lives.",0
"The show is an absolute work of art, everything from the writers to the actors produce an extremely intense and top-notch television experience. However, i do have a big gripe with the ending, this happens when the producers feel the unnecessary urge to subvert expectations and do something out of the ordinary. Please, there's no need to do so. The Sopranos and Breaking Bad have done it perfectly in the past, there's no need for some big last minute twist at the end. Kendall as CEO was something i as a viewer always rooted for and unobjectively he was the most qualified to be CEO among the successors. It simply felt awful to not see the man getting redeemed after all he's been over the seasons. He's been nothing but kind to his siblings but he's always received contempt from the inexperienced Siobhan who is a terrible sister and doesn't even come close to deserving the CEO position.",1
"The first 3 seasons were a rollercoaster of emotions to watch. The storyline was not predictable and kept the show interesting. None of the characters are likeable, but once in a while you find yourself cheering for one of them. The show is interesting to watch and well written. Then the series finale hits..... and it's garbage. We waited this long for this ending? Are you kidding me??!! It doesn't even make sense. I originally gave this show an 8, but after the ending I felt so cheated I logged back in and changed it to a 3. I wanted to rate it a 1, but the actors are really incredible and they are so good at their craft. I had to bump up the rating. But, the writing for the series finale is awful. So disappointing. I used to recommend this show to my friends, but won't be doing that anymore. I like my friends too much to subject them to this ending.",0
"First - I am addicted to this series. Beautifully written and acted. The concept that money and power bring only misery has to have a very broad appeal.

But - I almost gave up in the first episode because of the annoying camerawork. Random and unnecessay zooms in and out. The moment the camerawork draws attention to itself, a show is in trouble. The good news is that this style lessened as the season went on.

Another technical gripe. I am late to the game, and only in season two (at the last few episodes though). Yesterday when I sat down to enjoy another hour with this wonderfully disfunctional family, HBO MAX had become HBO. No problem there. The switch was seamless. However the show was suddenly in HDR. And a one time excellent picture looked like low class video (I am surprised to discover that it is actually shot on 35 mm film). I am now seeking ways to turn off the HDR.

Sorry about the gripes. It's otherwise great.",1
"On the surface Succession is decent enough. We've got a fairly high production value, acting ranging from good to outstanding, passable writing, and initially the dialogue feels tangible. The characters start off as interesting, if for nothing else because they live and move in circumstances that most of us will never experience. The show dazzles us with a look into a world that is extremely opulent and outrageoulsy decadent.

As we progress, however, the show does become somewhat repetitive. It's the same power struggle, for the same stakes, with the same players back-stabbing each other again and again. In the fourth season stakes are raised as we veer into a US presidential election, but it is still framed from the perspective of the Roy family and their corporate schemes.

For me, the show stumbles primarily on two fronts. Firstly, the main characters are irredeemably awful people. They're vapid, immature, greedy, self-centered, unpleasant and at times outright evil. We can't in good conscience root for any of them to come through, and whenever they do succeed we're left wishing they hadn't.

Secondly, Succession drops the ball on showing the real world consequences of how these terrible characters act. People who are laid off by the hundreds over a Zoom call? Never heard from again. Victims of abuse? A few minutes of screentime in a single episode and then gone forever. Political protestors? Merely faceless sign-holding crowds with no discernable agenda of their own.

It is a major flaw that the story is told exclusively from the point of view of the Roy family and their minions. We only ever learn about their motivations, and everyone else exist simply as pawns or obstacles in the Roy family plots and schemes. This one-two punch of irredeemable main characters, and no external view or opposition that we can empathize with leaves the viewer nowhere to go and no-one to relate to.

It's a shame, because there was potential here to tell a compelling story about power, influence and corruption. We could have had the perspective of DOJ prosecutors, SEC watch-dogs, a corporate whistleblower, laid off employees strugling after being sacked, or any number of servants traumatized by working for the Roys. What we get instead is really just a four seasons long showcase of how awful and decadent rich people can be.",0
"I've never reviewed a show before, but i couldn't help myself doing so after watching Succession. It is a truly one of a kind series, with superb acting and great script. I have laughed and cried throughout all seasons and i am really sad it will soon be over...Whoever reads these reviews before deciding to watch something, please do yourselves a favour and give this show a try, i promise you won't regret it. I myself was skeptical at the beginning, giving the fact that this kind of story (revolving around the lives of super wealthy and influential people) is not usually one that i would be interested in, but after the first 3 episodes i knew this is going to be something magnificent and i was right.",1
"Because there are too many repeated plots, it seems a bit boring. The first season still feels interesting, the second season almost runs out of memes, and there are no new stories to show in the third season. Anyway, I still patiently watched it all. I don't know why. Nowadays, TV dramas are always interesting at the beginning, but gradually get bored in the latter half. There are too few dramas that can be watched completely without fast forwarding. Anyway, I still patiently watched it all. I don't know why. Nowadays, TV dramas are always interesting at the beginning, but gradually get bored in the latter half. There are too few dramas that can be watched completely without fast forwarding.",1
"I HATED HATED HATED this show for 3 seasons. I hung in there because of the hype and thought i might be missing something. The Roy kids? Omg. Scheming, evil, starved for genuine love and incapable of showing or sustaining it. This show is so layered and nuanced yet can be blunt and crude. I do believe that the head of a multi billion dollar company has to be mercurial, controlling, strong and unrelenting! Right? Can one run that top 1/2% of company money and not be? Brian Cox? Come on! Incredible. Scene stealing. I do believe the type of entrepreneur he portrays have to be/are one in a billion. Can the offspring EVER live up to the creative genius? ALL ACTORS A+++++ (I have a theater degree too so Im not blowing smoke up..... ). I've never seen a series where I absolutely despised all the main characters and then have it slowly, deliberately revealed like a chess game what made each of them the way they are portrayed. FLAWLESS WRITING! Kudos! If it ain't on the page it cannot be brought to life onscreen. Voyeuristic pleasures at Gobsmacking wealth in EVERY. Single. Scene. What a privileged yet unmistakably sad family. Great Television and HBO MAX is on a ROLL! I do hate that the current ""trend"" is for shows to bow out at their peak in popularity. How are they going to wrap up next weeks series finale???",1
"I'm late to this - just tried to get into season one this week. Made it to episode three and eventually forced myself to admit that I simply don't give a flying **** about any of the characters or the plot. This is a show about a family which I wouldn't urinate on if they were on fire - in fact I'd want to squirt them with lighter fluid and roast some marshmallows. Why does IMDB require 600 characters?!? I hardly call watching actors portraying pretentious spoiled brats a fun way to pass time or entertainment. In the end, to me, this is a boring show about vapid human beings that are consumed with themselves. Living in the real world I want to escape people like this not binge watch them - hard pass.",0
"The characters develop extremely slow. The kids stay in the same bubble of mediocrity too long. Shows get dragged on with mediocre bickering and no action while barely leaving the room. A lot of fake ""what if's"". The characters never really change, just a continuation of themselves. It's like a commentary on a specific public news agency, but that commentary is slanted and exaggerated. Really the whole time you are watching the show you are hoping for something crazy to happen that only rich people can pay for but it typically doesn't happen. It's mostly low stakes bs. The topical Democrat vs Republican the world is ending is lazy.",0
"Quickly shaping up to be one of the best shows on television, HBO show us why they have been home to prestige television for so long.

Brilliantly crafted and masterfully told, succession is a show made to be released at this period in time.

As the one percent grows farther and farther away, humanizing them in such a manner while retaining their crassness is ingenious.

Succession succeds at reminding us we are all just hunans trying to achieve relatable goals. Some people just have larger warchests than others.

Jeremy Strongs as Kendall Roy gives a performance in this that i think in time will be as memorable at Tony Soparano in The Sopranos.

Don't miss this masterpiece.",1
"The show promise to deliver something good, but then you realize that is a sad point of view of someone who thinks this is the side B of being aristocratic or with a good position in society. Felt it like a resentful and exaggerated shout out from the writer perception of a misunderstood life style, the show delivers really bad energy in every aspect, every character story and performance leaves you with a biter taste and hangover, I think the show is too focused on showing how bad a exclusive lifestyle is supposed to be, instead of telling you a bigger picture drama/comedy leaving the audience the free understanding or feeling that the story might leave them, Basically, tried too hard to make a point.",0
"Completing riveting, I decided to give this series a chance even though I'm not fascinated by Pretentious Business People who think their sitting job is some sacrifice or some contribution. I laughed and was quite amused by keenly observing the psychologies being depicted that are inspired by certain mileaus in existence in the real world.

Watching Succession is a Masterclass in realizing how feeble and inept a whole of people and lifestyles can be, mainly pale people loathing by there ancestors genocided all the natives, to be fashionable, not having actual reasons . These people have no real world problems but they're sick so they're sad clowns doing loathing gymnastics to make something out of nothing so they can try to relate with real people with real lifestyles, from real parts of world where they actually have to do them and be at least marginally brave. Ofcourse these characters are parallels of inept people that would have to pay expensive confidence artist therapists lots of money to hear about their non-problems because ofcourse you'd have to pay lots of money for a real person not to laugh in your face and show they're entertained by your routine.

Only cowardly palies and pale way of clumsying through life could find this show serious. Shows none of them can lead a real life. But other than that. I enjoy these depictions.",1
"Watched every episode. 2 episodes left to wrap this up. S4 seems to have episodes that contain far too much filler, even though it is still very well done. Smoke and mirrors that leaves me wishing for less cutesy business slang and choppy scenes & camera work, and more A-List drama. Still, it has all the elements that i really like about this show, but reminds one that a good read/good watch must have a good ending to be fulfilling. Recommend to family and friends, especially for the powerhouse roles that have been filled by those well over 60yrs old. Excellent! With all the good to Great series to come out of the top cable & streaming, it just seems HBO absolutely nails it, over and over. Here's to this one finishing strong.",1
"People have referred to the show as being inspired by King Lear but really it's just a drama version of Arrested Development. A rich family fighting over their father's (although Lucille is more like Logan since she truly runs the company) company while having very little experience to actually run the company. To some of the kids it's actually important, to others it's about the prestige and money and just something to do. Siobhan and Tom are Lindsay and Tobias. (Shiv and Lindsay being 'liberal' when it suites them, Tom and Tobias being the geeky misfit husband who they got together with for the wrong reasons). Roman is Buster with his mommy issues. Connor is Gob, eternally trying for a career that is not for them. Ewan is Oscar, the antithesis of their brothers.

The only question is, is Willa, Rhea, or Kerry Egg/Her?",1
"Great show, but I'm giving it a ONE star due to having to watch it in extremely small spurts of time. The camera movement all over the place and zooming in and out all the time is horrible. I don't know who thought this style of footage is actually good, or a good idea. In a world thats heavy on independent social media, and making our own videos, it's extremely noticeable. Was any thought at all given to this? Who approved this horrible idea?

As a side note because these reviews call for 600 characters, I'll add Shivs relationship with such a weak man is just a little too unbelievable.

The actors play their individual roles really well.",0
"The show is like the Borgias without the love. Lots of dramatic music for very limited action. Endless stumbling and fumbling conversations that lead nowhere. Nonstop abuse and foul language one never experiences at work or in real life. Writers are clearly lacking in real talent, so they substitute skill with incoherence and cynicism. They should all be fired for producing such a high level of tedium and be replaced by AI. Every now and then a humorous line is spat out of a character, usually Roman, but it quickly evaporates in the insipid, arid drivel that follows. Episodes are best observed with the fast forward key.",0
"argon. No complete sentences.

A bunch of nothing about absolutely NOTHING!

Dysfunction at its finest. Would have been so much better to have an insight into the actual professional boardroom conversations - if they do actually exist!

The dynamics of sibling relationships can be very enlightening and disturbing at same time.

I wasn't disappointed to know it was the last season. No more wasted episode watching!

Wth - totally dysfunctional relationship between Jerry and Roman!

Shiv's husband and his cousin are total parasites!

The scary thing is that this could totally be families behind current businesses.",0
"What a cracker!

Firstly the actors make it and what a great combo with adlibs and wonderful script.

Where most series milk the best bits and overdo this as series progress this just gets better.

A Macfadyen masterclass that just gets better and better. What a performance!!

Wambsgans and Hirsch combo is so good and builds through the series into the 4th which is epic.

A thoroughly enjoyable and modern drama that is different but has some real grit and backbone in the story.

From season 1 it builds up very nicely and you get on with the characters that develop over time. You feel part of it and can't wait for the next episode.

Season 4 you really see the best of Kendall and the takeover episode in Scandinavia is a cracker.",1
"And the streak continues! Such a good episode! Returned to each character having their own angle and plotting for their own self gain. Great early performance from Roman and chaotic firing scenes. But from there Kendall carries the episode and I love when doom is about to fall on Kendall but then he really comes out on top. Those are honestly the better episodes of the series. Kendall is turning into a dog and he's always been good at thinking on his feet in a public moment of pressure. Roman is going to break down and not last, his dad only really used him because he was still young and impressionable. He has his moments, but he's best when under the radar and when expectations are low. Now as for Shiv, she seems to be switching sides and losing whichever way she goes. She's probably going to be #2 for Menkken, and go after Kendall that way. But all in all, Kendall shines in this episode!",1
"Actors are.good, but the screenplay is horrible.

The characters are shallow. Not even in the worst family business people would make decisions with no information. Everything in this series looks like a shouting contest, like one of those old pirate movies where swordfights were actually won by talking the opponent.

There was so much potential, but directors messed up. It's slow. Very slow. It's like if ""This is us"" was narrated by Samuel L. Jackson.

Back to characters shallowness... They are unidimensional. We.arent told why they think and act like they do. The worst of them is Roman, who is always in the high ground, but there isn't any explanation on where his power come from.

Of course it's information, leverage over other people because he knows something that can be used against opponents, but he actually doesn't have anything. Every battle is won by the character with the faultiest mouth.

In the real world, a company like that would never have reached its current state, with so many incompetent individuals ahead of it. It's very, very unlikely that the whole plot is even plausible.

Bad show. Bad show.",0
"The first three season were pretty alright, I'd give them a solid 7 but season 4 kind of destroys it all.

Every episode is the same. Endless conversations consisting of half sentences,allusions and buzzwords without any substance. It is as if the writers themselves don't know where the show is going. After Logan's death the show is as headless as the company in the series.

Unlikable characters, unreasonable and uninteresting plots, no red line whatsoever. You don't really wanna know what comes next as it is without consequences anyways. I rarely think a series should stop before being finished but it would have been better to stop after season 3 in all honesty.",0
"10/10

Logan is the best character in the show. His kids are ungrateful.

"The first two Seasons were wild and crazy. I just loved it.

Now, im just going, what the heck happened? Are there new writers? Did they lose interest? I dont get it. They had a great team of actors and this season is just so hard to watch... its brutal. Even the acting is bad.

Is Shiv really pregnant in real life as she's gained a massive amount of weight, cut her hair which looks terrible and cant seem to act anymore.

Who does the camera shooting on this show? Its truly HORRIBLE! I know they are trying new things but my goodness, it makes you dizzy with all the focus in and out constantly.

Soooo, so disappointed. I dont think ill survive watching the rest of the Season, let alone another Season. Its just that bad :(",0
"Succession is a series that catches your attention from the first 20 seconds of the first chapter where Kendall is mentally preparing to enter a world where he has always wanted to climb, which is the CEO of Waystar, from the moment he comes out from the car you capture the vibe of the series and the friction that the brothers will have throughout the series to replace their father and take charge of his legacy as the head of the company.

The performances, the settings, the music, and the script are perfect, and I think the complexity of the characters is excellent in all areas, The series is deserving of winning all the awards and in my opinion, it should be in the top of the best series of all time, on a par with Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, The Wire, among others without a doubt entering the discussion.

Bravo to the producers and all the people involved in this masterpiece.",1
